\n\
Applicable Licenses\n\
\n\
Unless otherwise indicated, all Content made available by the

is provided to you under the terms and conditions of the Eclipse
Public\n\
License Version 1.0 (&quot;EPL&quot;). A copy of the EPL is provided with
this\n\
Content and is also available at http://www.eclipse.org/legal/epl-v10.html.\n\
For purposes of the EPL, &quot;Program&quot; will mean the Content.\n\
\n\
Content includes, but is not limited to, source code, object
code,\n\
documentation and other files maintained in the Eclipse.org CVS\n\
repository (&quot;Repository&quot;) in CVS modules (&quot;Modules&quot;) and made
available\n\
as downloadable archives (&quot;Downloads&quot;).\n\
\n\
- Content may be structured and packaged into modules to facilitate
delivering,\n\
extending, and upgrading the Content. Typical modules may include
plug-ins (&quot;Plug-ins&quot;),\n\
plug-in fragments (&quot;Fragments&quot;), and features (&quot;Features&quot;).\n\
- Each Plug-in or Fragment may be packaged as a sub-directory
or JAR (Java? ARchive)\n\
in a directory named &quot;plugins&quot;.\n\
- A Feature is a bundle of one or more Plug-ins and/or Fragments
and associated material.\n\
Each Feature may be packaged as a sub-directory in a directory
named &quot;features&quot;.\n\
Within a Feature, files named &quot;feature.xml&quot; may contain a list
of the names and version\n\
numbers of the Plug-ins and/or Fragments associated with that
Feature.\n\
- Features may also include other Features (&quot;Included Features&quot;).
Within a Feature, files\n\
named &quot;feature.xml&quot; may contain a list of the names and version
numbers of Included Features.\n\
\n\
Features may also include other Features (&quot;Included Features&quot;).
Files named\n\
&quot;feature.xml&quot; may contain a list of the names and version numbers
of\n\
Included Features.\n\
\n\
The terms and conditions governing Plug-ins and Fragments should
be\n\
contained in files named &quot;about.html&quot; (&quot;Abouts&quot;). The terms and\n\
conditions governing Features and Included Features should be
contained\n\
in files named &quot;license.html&quot; (&quot;Feature Licenses&quot;). Abouts and
Feature\n\
Licenses may be located in any directory of a Download or Module\n\
including, but not limited to the following locations:\n\
\n\
- The top-level (root) directory\n\
- Plug-in and Fragment directories\n\
- Inside Plug-ins and Fragments packaged as JARs\n\
- Sub-directories of the directory named &quot;src&quot; of certain Plug-ins\n\
- Feature directories\n\
\n\
Note: if a Feature made available by the Eclipse Foundation is
installed using the\n\
Eclipse Update Manager, you must agree to a license (&quot;Feature
Update\n\
License&quot;) during the installation process. If the Feature contains\n\
Included Features, the Feature Update License should either provide
you\n\
with the terms and conditions governing the Included Features
or inform\n\
you where you can locate them. Feature Update Licenses may be
found in\n\
the &quot;license&quot; property of files named &quot;feature.properties&quot;. Such
Abouts,\n\
Feature Licenses and Feature Update Licenses contain the terms
and\n\
conditions (or references to such terms and conditions) that
govern your\n\
