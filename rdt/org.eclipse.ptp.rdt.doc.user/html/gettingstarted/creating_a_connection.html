<h1>Connecting to a Remote RDT Server</h1>

<p><span class="bold">Creating a connection from the Remote Systems view</span></p>

<p>
The <strong>Remote Systems</strong> view is by default part of the <strong>Remote C/C++</strong> perspective. 
To open this perspective from the workbench menu, click <strong>Window &gt; Open Perspective &gt; Remote C/C++</strong>.
</p>

<p>
Alternatively, to open the <strong>Remote Systems</strong> view regardless of which perspective is active;
from the workbench menu click <strong>Window &gt; Open View &gt; Remote Systems</strong>.
</p>

<p> 
In the <strong>Remote Systems</strong> view, click the <strong>New Connection</strong> toolbar button.

<p>
Alternatively it is also possible to create a connection from the RSE 
remote system file browse dialog. This dialog can be launched from the
<strong>New Remote C/C++ Project Wizard</strong>.

<!-- TODO link to the RSE SSH page -->
<p>
Either action will launch the <strong>Select Remote System Type</strong> dialog. From this dialog you may 
create a new connection. 
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Choose either Linux, Unix or Windows as
the server type depending on the operating system that is hosting the RDT sever. For MacOS X choose
Unix as the system type. Do not choose SSH, Telnet or FTP as the RDT server will not work with these
connection types (RDT requires a dstore connection). 
</li>
<li>
Enter a name for your first profile and click <strong>Next</strong>. (This step only occurs if you have never defined a connection before.) 
</li>
<li>
Enter a connection name. This name displays in your tree view and must be unique to the profile.
</li>
<li> 
Enter the name or TCP/IP address of your server in the <strong>Host name</strong> field.
</li>
<li> 
(Optional) Enter a Description. The description appears in the Properties view after the connection is created.
</li>
<li>
Click <strong>Next</strong>.
</li>
<li>
On the second page of the New Connection Wizard click <strong>Launcher Properties</strong> under the <strong>Available Services</strong>
section. The properties section of the dialog can be used to specify if the connection is to a
daemon server or to a standalone (manually started) server.
</li>
<li> 
Click <strong>Finish</strong> to define your system. The new connection will appear in the Remote Systems View.
</li>
<li>
To activate the connection right click on the connection name in the Remote Systems view
and select <strong>Connect</strong>. You may be prompted for a username and password.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Once a connection has been created it may still be necessary to define the port
and other <a href="editing_connection_properties.html">properties for the connection</a>.
