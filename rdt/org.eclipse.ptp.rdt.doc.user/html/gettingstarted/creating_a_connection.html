<h1>Connecting to a Remote RDT Server</h1>

<p><b>Creating a connection from the Remote Systems view</b></p>

<p>
The <b>Remote Systems</b> view is by default part of the <b>Remote C/C++ Development</b> perspective. 
To open this perspective from the workbench menu, click <b>Window &gt; Open Perspective &gt; Remote C/C++ Development</b>.
</p>

<p>
Alternatively, to open the <b>Remote Systems</b> view regardless of which perspective is active;
from the workbench menu click <b>Window &gt; Open View &gt; Remote Systems</b>.
</p>

<p> 
In the <b>Remote Systems</b> view, click the <b>New Connection</b> toolbar button.
</p>

<p><b>Creating a connection from the RSE Browse Dialog</b></p>

<p>
Alternatively it is also possible to create a connection from the RSE 
remote system file browse dialog. This dialog can be launched from the
<b>New Remote C/C++ Project Wizard</b>.
</p>

<p><b>Creating a Connection</b></p>

<!-- TODO link to the RSE SSH page -->
<p>
Either action will launch the <b>Select Remote System Type</b> dialog. From this dialog you may 
create a new connection. 
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Choose either Linux, Unix or Windows as
the server type depending on the operating system that is hosting the RDT sever. For MacOS X choose
Unix as the system type. Do not choose SSH, Telnet or FTP as the RDT server will not work with these
connection types (RDT requires a dstore connection). 
To connect to an RDT server over an SSH connection see here.
</li>
<li>
Enter a name for your first profile and click <b>Next</b>. (This step only occurs if you have never defined a connection before.) 
</li>
<li>
Enter a connection name. This name displays in your tree view and must be unique to the profile.
</li>
<li> 
Enter the name or TCP/IP address of your server in the <b>Host name</b> field.
</li>
<li> 
(Optional) Enter a Description. The description appears in the Properties view after the connection is created.
</li>
<li>
Click <b>Next</b>.
</li>
<li>
On the second page of the New Connection Wizard click <b>Launcher Properties</b> under the <b>Available Services</b>
section. The properties section of the dialog can be used to specify if the connection is to a
daemon server or to a standalone (manually started) server.
</li>
<li> 
Click <b>Finish</b> to define your system. The new connection will appear in the Remote Systems View.
</li>
<li>
To activate the connection right click on the connection name in the Remote Systems view
and select <b>Connect</b>. You may be prompted for a username and password.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Once a connection has been created it may still be necessary to define the port
and other <a href="editing_connection_properties.html">properties for the connection</a>.
