<h1>RDT Server Installation on Windows</h1>
The following documentation explains how to install the Windows server code, 
start the server daemon, and make a connection to a remote Windows server. 
<a href="server_installation_unix.html">Look here</a> for setting 
up a server on Linux, General UNIX or Mac.

<p><b>Installing the server code</b></p>

<p>
<ol>
<li>
Choose a directory where you want to install the server code. 
These instructions will use the <tt>C:/</tt> directory as an example, 
but you are free to use any directory.
When the server archive file is expanded it will create a directory 
named <tt>rdt-server</tt> in the location where it
is expanded.
</li>
<li> 
Find the package that contains the server.
</li>
<li> 
Copy the file <tt>rdt-server-windows-1.0.zip</tt> to 
the <tt>C:\</tt> directory (this could be on a different machine).
</li>
<li> 
Use an unzip utility to extract the server code.
</li>
<li>A directory named <tt>C:\rdt-server</tt> will be created that contains the server files.</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p><b>Starting the server</b></p>

<p>
You can start the RDT communications server manually, or as a daemon.
</p>

<p><b>To start the server as a daemon</b></p>

<p>
Note that the server daemon does not enforce any user authentication. 
If you run the server daemon, any user can connect to the machine, 
work with the file system and run commands. <b>Use of the server daemon 
on Windows systems is not recommended</b>.
</p>
 
<p>
Simply double click the <tt>daemon.bat</tt> program to start a server daemon. 
You can edit the <tt>daemon.bat</tt> file to change properties for the daemon, 
like a specific daemon port to use or to force a port range for the server 
(in order to comply with firewalls). 
</p>

</p>
The server daemon runs on port 4075 by default. You can pass the optional 
daemonPort argument to force a different port if you want.
</p>

<p>
If your daemon runs behind a firewall, you may want to specify the optional serverPortRange 
argument to restrict selected server ports to the range given:
</p>

<pre class="command">daemon.bat 4075 10000-10010</pre>

<p><b>To start the server manually</b></p> 

<p>
Simply double click on the <tt>server.bat</tt> program to start the RDT server. 
The server will pick the first port available and print the port number. 
By default, it is usually 4033. You will then have to enter this port 
number in port property for the Files subsystem for your connection in 
the Remote System Explorer.
</p> 

<p>
For security reasons, the server will only wait a limited time until 
a client connects (12000 seconds by default). 
In order to start the server with an exactly specified 
port or timeout, open a Windows command prompt and enter:
</p> 

<pre class="command">
c:
cd \rdt-server
server.bat [port] [timeout]
</pre>

When you connect RDT to the server, the server will terminate as soon as 
you disconnect the client. The daemon, however, will not terminate.
