<title>Editing Connection Properties</title>

<h1>Editing Connection Properties</h1>
<p>
Once a connection has been created it may still be necessary to define the port
and other properties for the connection. This is a common cause of connection problems.
</p>

<p>
You can monitor and change the properties of your connection in the <b>Properties</b> view.
To open this view from the workbench menu go to <b>Window &gt; Show View &gt; Properties</b>. 
You are able to change some values such as the description or the server name. 
Although each Remote System Explorer subsystem maintains its own list of 
properties, three properties (connected or disconnected, port, and user ID) 
are shared among all subsystems. If you change any of these properties in one 
subsystem, the other subsystems reflect the change.
</p>

<p>
Select a subsystem and check the Properties view to see the shared properties 
for all of your subsystems. For example, the Connected value is Yes or No for 
all of your subsystems under one connection.
</p>

<p>
It is also possible to view and edit the Properties of the subsystems using
the <b>Remote System Details</b> view. To do this, right click on a connection in the 
Remote Systems view and select <b>Show In Table</b>.
</p>

<p>
In review, there are various methods for changing the properties for a connection:
<ol>
  <li>Right click on the connection name in the <b>Remote Systems</b> view and select <b>Properties</b>.
  </li>
  <li>Expand the connection so that the available subsystems are listed. To modify the
      properties specific to a particular subsystem right click on the subsystem and select <b>Properties</b>.
  </li>
  <li>Open the Properties view (Window &gt; Show View &gt; Properties). 
      Select a connection or subsystem and its properties will be displayed in the Properties view.
  </li>
  <li>Right click on a connection in the Remote Systems view and select <b>Show In Table</b>.
      This will show all the properties of all the subsystems in the <b>Remote System Details</b> view.
      This view allows the port used by the various subsystems to be changed.
   </li>
</ol>
