<h1>Important Notes Before You Begin</h1>

<h2>Supported Usage Model of RDT</h2>

<p>RDT currently provides a framework for developing C/C++ programs on remote
machines. Although it is our intention that RDT work seamlessly with CDT and
other Eclipse plug-ins, there is a problem with the Eclipse platform which
hinders interoperabilty between base CDT and RDT, namely that the Remote C/C++
Editor provided by RDT is always used for editing C/C++ files.</p>

<p>Although this issue can be worked around by manually selecting the CDT
editor (Context Menu-&gt;Open With-&gt;C/C++ Editor) when you are working with
a local CDT project, it can be tedious having to do this for every single file
you open. As such, we recommend that you install RDT into an Eclipse
installation which you do not intend to do local C/C++ development with. Future
versions of Eclipse and RDT should better support local development.</p>
