<h1>Important Notes Before You Begin</h1>
<h2>Supported Usage Model of RDT</h2>
<p>RDT currently provides a framework for developing C/C++ programs on remote machines. Although it is our intention that RDT work seamlessly with CDT and other Eclipse plug-ins, there is a problem with the Eclipse platform which hinders interoperabilty between base CDT and RDT, namely that the Remote C/C++ Editor provided by RDT is always used for editing C/C++ files.</p>
<p>Although this issue can be worked around by manually selecting
the CDT editor (Context Menu-&gt;Open With-&gt;C/C++ Editor) when you
are working with a local CDT project, it can be tedious having to do
this for every single file you open. As such, we recommend that you
install RDT into an Eclipse installation which you do not intend to do
local C/C++ development with. Future versions of Eclipse and RDT should better support local development.</p>
