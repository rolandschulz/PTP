         Build Service
      </h2>
      <p>
         The Build Service represents the execution and file manipulation services required by a builder to execute external build commands on
         the target system.  A <em>builder</em> is still required which utilizes the build service to execute the commands to perform the build.
      </p>
      The <strong>Remote Build Service</strong> provider is supplied with RDT.  This implementation uses the PTP Remote Services API to provide build services.
      	Currently there are three possible sub-choices for these services:
      	<UL type="circle">
      	<li>Local - Services are executed on the local machine.</li>
      	<li>Remote Tools - A lightweight SSH-based implementation.</li>
      	<li>RSE - An implementation based on the <a href="PLUGINS_ROOT/org.eclipse.rse.doc.user/gettingstarted/g_start.html">Remote Systems Explorer.</a></li>
      	</UL>
