         Build Service
      </h2>
      <p>
         The Build Service represents the execution and file manipulation services required by a builder to execute external build commands on
         the target system.  A <i>builder</i> is still required which utilizes the build service to execute the commands to perform the build.
      </p>
      <p>There are two implementations of the build service supplied with RDT, in the form of <a href=providers.html>Service Providers</a>:</p>
      	<UL type="disc">
      	<li>The <b>Null Build Service</b> provider.  This implementation does nothing when asked to build.  It is useful if you wish to use other services
      	do not need to build the project.</li>
      	<li>The <b>RDT Remote Build Service</b> provider.  This implementation uses the PTP Remote Services API to provide build services.
      	Currently there are three possible sub-choices for these services:</li>
      	<UL type="circle">
      	<li>Local - Services are executed on the local machine.</li>
      	<li>Remote Tools - A lightweight SSH-based implementation.</li>
      	<li>RSE - An implementation based on the <a href="PLUGINS_ROOT/org.eclipse.rse.doc.user/gettingstarted/g_start.html">Remote Systems Explorer.</a></li>
      	</UL>
