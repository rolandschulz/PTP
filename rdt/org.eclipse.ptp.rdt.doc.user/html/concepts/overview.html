      <h2>Remote
      Development Tools Overview</h2>
<p>RDT provides a framework,  and a reference implementation of that framework, that facilitates using a local IDE to perform development tasks on another, remote machine.</p>
<p>The main motivation behind this is for development on high performance scientific computers, and for mainframe computing. The characteristics of developing for these machines that especially necessitate a remote development environment are several:<br>
</p>
<li>The machines themselves are often centralized at some remote location, and cannot be accessed physically by the user. </li>
<li>The tools experience of Eclipse tends to be much richer than
that of command line tools</li>
<li>The performance of displaying a graphically rich tool such as Eclipse over a remote graphics protocol such as X11 is typically very slow, especially for latent connections which are geographically distributed.</li>
<li>Servers may not have any native graphical capabilities with which to display graphical tools<br>
<br>The overall concept behind RDT is to use the Eclipse IDE as a thin front end, and offload the majority of the processing to services running on the remote machine itself. By doing this, a rich feature set can be attained, while maintaining an acceptable level of performance compared to running the entire IDE locally.<br>
</li><p>RDT initially provides services for remote C/C++ development, but the RDT service framework is designed to support any arbitrary language.<br>
<br>The core concept of the RDT framework is the <a
