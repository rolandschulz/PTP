         Service Providers

      <p>
         Service Providers provide implementations of a <a href=services.html>Service</a>.  Usually, the different providers implement a different mechanism for
         doing the same task.  For example, a Build service might have a provider that provides the ability to execute build commands over a remote protocol such
         as SSH, whereas another provider may cross-compile the binaries on the local machine and then upload them to the remote machine.
