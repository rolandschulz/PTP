         Services

      <p>Services are essentially well defined sets of functionality which can be provided by <a href=providers.html>Service Providers</a>.  Typically, a service is defined as fulfilling some API contract which providers of that service are expected to implement.  RDT defines two canonical services:</p>
         <li>The <a href=build_service.html>Build Service</a></li>
         <li>The <a href=c_indexing_service.html>C/C++ Indexing Service</a></li>
         
         <BR><BR><p>The RDT framework allows for definitions of additional, arbitrary services to be contributed to the system by additional plug-ins.</p>
