<h1>Remote Paths and Symbols, Symbols</h1>

<p>
Symbols are passed to the remote indexer and are used during preprocessing.
A symbol is essentially the same thing as an object-like macro. For example:
<br><br>
<code>
#define SYMBOL 1
</code>
</p>

<p>
If the remote builder has been configured properly then 
RDT may be able to automatically determine the symbols that are "built-in"
to the compiler on the remote machine.
</p>

<p>
Additional symbols may be provided in order to have the preprocessor
behave differently for different build configurations. For example if 
there is a "Debug" build configuration it may be desirable to define a symbol
named <b>DEBUG</b>. Preprocessor branches controlled by this symbol will
then become active. For example:
<br><br>
<code>
#ifdef DEBUG<br>
   // debugging code, becomes active if DEBUG is defined</br>
#endif
</code>
</p>
<p>
It may take some time to initially set up the symbols and other
project settings. In order to avoid having to perform this task for
multiple RDT installations an <a href="settings_wizard_export.html">import/export mechanism </a>is provided
to allow these settings to be easily shared.
</p>

<h2>Adding an Include</h2>
<p>
<img src="../../images/add_symbol_dialog.png" 
        alt="Add Symbol dialog">
</p>

<p>
Clicking <b>Add</b> on the Symbols properties page will cause
the <b>Add Symbol</b> dialog to appear. Enter the name of the symbol
and optionally a value. The name must be a valid identifier as understood
by the C/C++ preprocessor.
</p>

<p>
Check the <b>Add to all configurations</b> checkbox to add the symbol
to all build configurations, otherwise the symbol will only be added
to the build configuration that was selected on the properties page.
</p>

<p>
Check the <b>Add to all languages</b> checkbox to add the include path
to all languages, otherwise the symbol will only be added
to the language that was selected on the properties page.
