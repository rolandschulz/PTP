<h1>Remote Paths and Symbols, Includes</h1>

<p>
The remote indexer needs to know the location of header files in order
to parse them and add their contents to the index. The <b>Remote Includes</b>
tab of the <b>Remote Paths and Symbols</b> properties page allows you to
add, remove and reorder the include paths that are used to find
header files on the remote machine.
</p>
<p>
The paths must be given in a format that is appropriate for the operating
system of the machine where the remote indexer is located.
</p>
<p>
If the remote builder has been configured properly,  
RDT may be able to automatically determine the include paths used by the 
compiler on the remote machine. These include paths are called "built-in".
If RDT is not able to automatically determine the include paths, or if
additional include paths are needed, you must add them manually.
</p>
<p>
It may take some time to initially set up the include paths and other
project settings. In order to avoid having to perform this task for
multiple RDT installations an <a href="settings_wizard_export.html">import/export mechanism</a> is provided
to allow these settings to be easily shared.

</p>

<p>
Click <b>Add</b> on the Remote Paths properties page. The <b>Remote Include Directory</b> dialog 
appears. Enter a valid path on the
remote machine, or click <b>Browse...</b> to use a dialog to select a directory on the remote machine. 
</p>

<p>
Check the <b>Add to all configurations</b> checkbox to add the include path
to all build configurations, otherwise the include path will only be added
to the build configuration that was selected on the properties page.
</p>

<p>
Check the <b>Add to all languages</b> checkbox to add the include path
to all languages, otherwise the include path will only be added
to the language that was selected on the properties page.
