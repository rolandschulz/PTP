! these first three lines were from note 7.10
a = lbound(b,1) + 5
a = m + len(c)
a = 2 + precision(a)

! these are extra tests that i added 
a = 2 - precision(a)
a = 2 ** precision(a)
a = precision(a) * 2
a = 2 * precision(a)
a = m + len(c)
a = 2 * precision(a)
a = 2 * integer(a)
a = 2 * dimension(a)
a = 2 * integer
a = precision(a) * integer
a = precision(a) * dimension(a)
a = result
end
