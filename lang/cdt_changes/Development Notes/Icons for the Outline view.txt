How do icons make their way into the CDT Outline view?

The Outline view basically displays one translation unit's (file's) part
of the CModel (ICElement hierarchy).  The icons displayed are based on
the types of the individual ICElements in the hierarchy (see
ICElement.getElementType()).

CContentOutlinePage creates a DecoratingCLabelProvider around a
StandardCElementLabelProvider, which inherits from an
AppearanceAwareLabelProvider, which inherits from CUILabelProvider,
which uses a CElementImageProvider to load icons from the resource bundle
for the UI plugin by creating URLs to the individual icons.

See CElementImageProvider#getImageLabel, which calls
getCImageDescriptor, which calls getBaseImageDescriptor, which is where
there lies a giant case statement lies, which returns the ImageDescriptor.
