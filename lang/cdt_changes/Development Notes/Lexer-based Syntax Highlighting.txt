Nicholas and Cheah integrated lexer-based syntax highlighting based on
similar code from my EBNF editor.  The files involved were:

- F90DamageRepairer (created)
- Fortran90Partitioner (created)
- CTextTools (modified, but I later deleted it)
- CSourceViewer (modified)
- SingleTokenFScanner (copy of SingleTokenCScanner, but I later deleted it)

With the latest changes from CVS taken on July 14, 2005 (11.44 pm) we made the
following changes to reenable lexer based syntax highlighting:

- FortranDamageRepairer (modifed renamed from F90DamageRepairer)
- FortranPartitioner (modified renamed from Fortran90Partitioner)
- FortranTextTools (renamed and modified CTextTools)
-- this rename caused a few modifications to other files that used to reference CTextTools
- CSourceViewerConfiguration (modified)
- ColorSettingPreviewCode (modified)
-- included the photran sample file
-- deleted the lines that have C ... ... in them since the lexer
balks at those
- CCodeScanner (deleted)
- CPPCodeScanner (deleted)
- FastCPartitionScanner (deleted)
