This is the initial release of the PTP Scalable Debug Manager (SDM). The SDM is a framework for debugging parallel programs.
It comprises the following components:

1. An MPI-based client/server framework for controlling multiple distributed processes. The primary purpose of this
   framework is to attach backend debuggers to the processes being debugged, and to provide a library interface
   to control the debugging of these processes.
   
2. A proxy library that allows the client/server framework to be controlled from a remote location.  This is particularly
   important, since it is not always possible to know the location of the SDM client (it may be placed on a random
   node in the parallel machine).

3. A JNI library for interfacing Java applications to the proxy client. This allows applications like Eclipse to control
   the debug framework, respond to events, etc.
   
Basic Installation
==================

The simplest way to compile this package is:

  1. At the top level, run './configure' to create the Makefiles.

  2. Type `make' to build the package.

  3. You can remove the program binaries and object files from the
     source code directory by typing `make clean'.

If you modify Makefile.am and wish to regenerate the Makefile.in and
configure scripts:

  1. Make sure you have the latest versions of 'automake' and 
     'libtool' (at this time it is 1.9.6 and 1.5.20 respectively). 
     They can be obtained from ftp.gnu.org if necessary.
     
  2. Run 'autogen.sh' which will build the various configure scripts.
