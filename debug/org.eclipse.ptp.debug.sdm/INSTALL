PTP Scalable Debug Manager

Basic Installation
==================

The simplest way to compile this package is:

  1. Make sure you have the latest versions of 'automake' and 
     'libtool' (at this time it is 1.9.6 and 1.5.20 respectively). 
     They can be obtained from ftp.gnu.org if necessary.
     
  2. Run 'autoreconf' which will build the various configure scripts.

  3. At the top level, run './configure' to create the Makefiles.

  4. Type `make' to build the package.

  5. You can remove the program binaries and object files from the
     source code directory by typing `make clean'.
