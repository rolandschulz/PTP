     * <b>Important.</b> The parameters methods to this method are <i>not</i> redundant; they have a
     * somewhat confusing relationship that must be obeyed by the lexical analyzer that is created:
     * <ol>
     * <li><i>The lexer must ALWAYS read from the supplied {@link Reader} <code>in</code>.</i>
     * When a file is open in an editor but the editor has unsaved changes, the unsaved changes
     * should be parsed, not the file on disk, so that the Outline view appears correct. The current
     * editor contents are passed as the Reader. Still, the underlying {@link IFile} is made
     * available so that it can be used to determine the include paths used by the C preprocessor.
     * 
     * <li><i>If the {@link IFile} <code>file</code> is not null, it should be used to determine the
     * path to the file;</i> in this case the (String) <code>filename</code> is used only in error
     * messages and likely does NOT represent a valid filesystem path.
     * 
     * <li><i>If the {@link IFile} <code>file</code> is null, then we are parsing a file that is not
     * available in the workspace...</i>
     *     <ol>
     *     <li>If possible, the (String) filename should provide a full path to a file on the local
     *     filesystem; this will be used as the working directory when the C preprocessor processes
     *     #include directives.
     * 
     *     <li>If the filename does not point to a valid path on the local filesystem, #include
     *     directives will not be processed.
     *     </ol>
     * </ol>
