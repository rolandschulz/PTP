<h1>Introduction</h1>

The Rephraser Engine is an Eclipse-based library that expedites the development of refactoring tools.  It contains two components:
<ul>
<li> The <i>refactoring</i> component allows plug-ins to easily contribute refactorings to the Eclipse user interface.
<li> The <i>virtual program graph (VPG)</i> component provides a language-independent program database and indexing infrastructure.
</ul>

<p>These components are independent; some projects may choose to use the Refactoring component without using the VPG component, for example.  The dependencies among the projects comprising the Rephraser Engine are as follows.</p>

<h2>Features</h2>

<h3>Refactoring</h3>

<p>The Refactoring component extends the Eclipse Language ToolKit (LTK) and
<ul>
<li> contributes a Refactor menu to the workbench menu bar, as well as to the context menu for resource selections in the workbench;
<li> provides an extension point that allows refactorings to be contributed to this menu; and
<li> does not require any user interface code to be written for simple refactorings.
</ul></p>

<h3>VPG</h3>

<p>The VPG component
<ul>
<li> provides a set of base classes for building persistable program graphs;
<li> provides an indexing infrastructure by registering a resource listener and automatically updating program graphs as workspace resources change; and
<li> contributes a "(Debugging)" sub-menu to the workbench Refactoring menu, which provides various actions for viewing, analyzing, and manipulating VPG databases.
</ul></p>
