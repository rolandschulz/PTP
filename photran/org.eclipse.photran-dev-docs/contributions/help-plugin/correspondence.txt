Hi Jeff,
 
I uploaded an Eclipse help plug-in to Bugzilla along with a new screenshot. The plug-in doesn't contain source code (it's just XML, HTML, and images), so I didn't worry about the EPL headers or similar concerns. But if there's anything you'd like me to declare, please let me know.
 
In addition to the plug-in, I've created a Java project that reads Wiki markup in text files (e.g. photran5 and photran5advanced), and creates an Eclipse help plug-in. This way, as you update your Wiki, you can create an updated plug-in by running the application.
 
The project's libraries are so large that I couldn't upload the archive to Bugzilla. So I put it on my web site and you can download it here:
http://www.eclipseengineer.com/photran/WikiToEclipse.zip
 
The WikiToEclipse project is public domain. The instructions.txt file explains how to use it. Let me know if you have any questions.
 
Matt

Sharon,

I have an IP question, if you don't mind.

Matt Scarpino owns a consulting company (Eclipse Engineering, LLC) and
kindly wrote a converter for us which will generate Eclipse Help content
from the documentation we've been writing for Photran on the Eclipse Wiki.
He generated a plug-in for us using this converter, and that's posted on
Bugzilla - https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/286862

We would like to continue using his generator to re-generate our online help
as we update the wiki over time.

As you can see in Matt's e-mail below, the generator was too large to post
to Bugzilla, mostly because it uses some (large) third-party libraries.
Those are under the Apache and BSD licenses, so provenance checking would
probably take a while.

What are the IP requirements here?  Is it OK for us to use his generator
as-is, or will it need to be contributed to Photran or Orbit first?  I
copied him on this e-mail, so he can help answer any questions.

Jeff

Hi Jeff:

In order to further understand before I respond, can you let me know if the
intent is to check the content into the Eclipse repository?

Thanks,
Sharon

Hi,

I'd be happy to contribute the plug-in generator, but Jeffrey's main =
concern is whether the generated plug-ins can be added to the Photran =
codebase.

As I understand it, code licensing becomes an issue if the content =
depends on licensed code. But in this case, all of the content is being =
generated automatically. Once the plug-in is generated, it has no =
external dependencies.

The generator depends on Apache-licensed libraries, but that dependency =
doesn't extend to the generated plug-ins. I think Jeffrey can add the =
plug-ins to Photran without any licensing concerns, but I'm no expert.

Best,
Matt

We are only interested in checking the generated help content (HTML and 
XML) into the repository.

I bet Matt would be willing to contribute the entire generator if we 
need to (I don't know what the Foundation's rules about generating code 
are), but if we can avoid that and only check in the generated help 
project, that seems easiest.

Thanks.

Jeff

Hi Jeff:

Thanks for the info you provided as well as Matt's input.  In order to bring
this forward for a response could I ask you to provide (in layman's terms)
an overview statement/paragraph regarding this tool?  It will also be
important to understand if there is any license associated with the tool
that would impact the generated content from being licensed under the terms
of the EPL?

Regards,
Sharon

The WikiToEclipse tool takes a page from the Eclipse Wiki and translates 
it into an Eclipse Help plug-in.  The intention is to use this for 
Photran's end-user documentation, which is currently on the Eclipse 
Wiki; by translating it into an Eclipse Help plug-in, users without 
Internet access can still read the documentation inside the Eclipse Help 
system.

The translation from Eclipse Wiki markup to Eclipse Help markup is very 
straightforward.  The tool does the same translation we would do by 
hand.  Since it is just translating one kind of documentation into a 
different kind of documentation (more or less like translating a Word 
document into a WordPerfect document), the generated result does not 
depend on any third-party libraries.

Matt has placed the WikiToEclipse project in the public domain.  It uses 
some BSD-licensed third-party libraries to read the input, etc., but the 
output it generates in no way depends on these libraries; again, the 
output (an Eclipse Help plug-in) is just a straightforward translation 
of the input (an Eclipse Wiki page).  So, from what I can tell, and from 
what Matt has told me, there is nothing preventing us from licensing the 
generated Eclipse Help plug-in under the EPL.

Hi Jeff:

You are good to go with respect to using the generated content in the
Eclipse repository.  

If at some point in the future, you wish to check the generator tool itself
into the repository; you will of course need to raise CQs as would be
required.

Regards,
Sharon
