% Getting the Photran 3.0 Sources from CVS

\hspace{1em}\textbf{Part I.  Check out the CDT sources from CVS}

\begin{enumerate}
\item  In Eclipse, switch to the CVS Repository Exploring perspective.
\item  Right-click the CVS Repositories view; choose New, Repository Location
\item  Enter the following information, then click Finish: \\
\begin{tabular}{ll}
         Host name:       & dev.eclipse.org \\
         Repository path: & /home/tools \\
         Connection type: & pserver \\
         Username:        & anonymous \\
         Password:        & (no password) \\
\end{tabular}
\item  Right-click on :pserver:anonymous@dev.eclipse.org:/home/tools, and choose
    Refresh Branches...
\item  Select the following, and click OK:
\begin{itemize}
    \item     org.eclipse.cdt-build
    \item     org.eclipse.cdt-core
    \item     org.eclipse.cdt-doc
    \item     org.eclipse.cdt-debug
    \item     org.eclipse.cdt-launch
\end{itemize}
    When prompted, tell it to Search Deeply.
\item  Expand :pserver:anonymous@dev.eclipse.org:/home/tools,
    and then expand Versions (in the CVS Repositories view)
\item  Under org.eclipse.cdt-build, expand org.eclipse.cdt-build CDT\_3\_0\_RC2
\item  Right click and check out all of the org.eclipse.cdt.* packages
    EXCEPT for the ones ending in "tests" (why bother testing?)
\item  Do the same with org.eclipse.cdt-core, org.eclipse.cdt-debug,
    org.eclipse.cdt-doc, and org.eclipse.cdt-launch
\item You now have the CDT source code.  Make sure it compiles successfully
    (lots of warnings, but no errors).

\noindent\textbf{Part II.  Check out the Photran source and the CDT patches}

\item In Eclipse, switch to the CVS Repository Exploring perspective.
\item Right-click the CVS Repositories view; choose New, Repository Location
\item Enter the following information, then click Finish: \\
\begin{tabular}{ll}
        Host name:       & www.photran.org \\
        Repository path: & /usr/local/photran30-new \\
        Connection type: & extssh \\
        Username/passwd: & (we gave you this) \\
\end{tabular}
\item Expand extssh:username@www.photran.org:/usr/local/photran30-new,
    then expand HEAD (in the CVS Repositories view)
\item{Right-click and check out all of the org.eclipse.photran projects EXCEPT
    org.eclipse.photran-parser.
    You only need this project if you will be regenerating the parser from the
    grammar.  (The parser is included in the org.eclipse.photran.core plug-in
    as a JAR file.  This way, the parser does not have to be recompiled
    every time you rebuild Photran.)}

The sources will NOT compile at this point; you must complete the following...

\noindent\textbf{Part III.  Patch the CDT sources}

\item Go to a bash prompt.  Change to your Eclipse workspace directory
    (the one containing all of the org.eclipse.cdt and
    org.eclipse.photran projects).
\item Change (\texttt{cd}) to the org.eclipse.photran-cdt-patches directory.
\item Run ./install
\item{Go back into Eclipse.  Refresh all of the org.eclipse.cdt packages.
    (Click the first, shift-click the last, right-click, choose Refresh.)}

The sources should all compile (albeit with about 640 warnings).
\end{enumerate}
