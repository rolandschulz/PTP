% CDT Integration

Previous versions of Photran were developed by hacking the CDT: essentially,
we made the user interface say ``Fortran'' instead of ``C/C++,'' we replaced the
model builder (which creates the Outline view, among other things) with one
that ran a Fortran parser, we changed the list of file extensions, and we
modified the syntax highlighting code to recognize Fortran comments and
keywords.

Starting with Photran 3.0, we are taking a fundamentally different approach:
\begin{itemize}
\item We rename the C/C++ Perspective to the Make Perspective.  We replace
the four project types (C Standard Make Project, C++ Standard Make Project,
C Managed Make Project, and C++ Managed Make Project) with two generic
project types (Standard Make Project and Managed Make Project).  We also
change the launcher's menu item to read ``Run Local Application'' rather
than ``Run Local C Application.''  These are all superficial changes
(i.e., changes to labels and icons, not to the underlying code).  The
Make project types use the natures formerly used for C projects.
\item We add an extension point to the CDT which allows it to recognize
other languages besides C and C++.
\end{itemize}

\section{Integrating with the CDT: The \texttt{AdditionalLanguages}
            Extension Point}

The org.eclipse.photran.xyzsamplelang project is a simple example of how
to integrate a new language into the CDT.  Its README is included in an
appendix.

Essentially, the process of integrating a new language into the CDT works
as follows:
\begin{itemize}

\item Create a new plug-in with an editor.  (Obviously, you will eventually
want to customize the editor for your language.)

\item For each filename extension supported by your editor (i.e., each
filename extension for files in your language), declare a (text) content type.
\begin{verbatim}
   <extension point="org.eclipse.core.runtime.contentTypes">
      <content-type id="xyzSource" name="XYZ Language Source File"
            base-type="org.eclipse.core.runtime.text"
            priority="high"/>
      <file-association
            content-type="xyzSource"
            file-extensions="xyz"/>
   </extension>
\end{verbatim}

\item Specify org.eclipse.cdt.core as a dependency of your plug-in, and
declare in your \texttt{plugin.xml} that you are extending the
org.eclipse.cdt.core.AdditionalLanguages extension point.
\begin{verbatim}
   <extension point="org.eclipse.cdt.core.AdditionalLanguages">
      <language class="addl_langs.XYZLanguage"/>
   </extension>
\end{verbatim}
You must provide the fully-qualified name of a class
(\texttt{addl\_langs.XYZLanguage}, in this case which implements the
\texttt{org.eclipse.cdt.core.addl\_langs.IAdditionalLanguage} interface.

\item Fill in the definition of that class.  See the JavaDoc in
\texttt{IAdditionalLanguage} for more information.
\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{getName} just returns the name of the language
(Fortran, XYZ Sample Language, etc.)
\item \texttt{getRegisteredContentTypeIds} returns a list of all of
the content types you declared above.  The content type names must
be fully qualified, i.e., the name of the plug-in followed by the name
of the content type, e.g., \texttt{XyzLanguagePlugIn.xyzSource}
or \texttt{org.eclipse.photran.core.fortranSource}.
\item \texttt{createModelBuilder} returns a model builder for your
language.  Look at the \texttt{ToyModelBuilder} in the XYZ Sample Language
project for a (trivial) example of how a model builder works, and
see the JavaDoc for \texttt{IModelBuilder} for a more complete description.
In essence,
\begin{itemize}
\item It must implement \texttt{IModelBuilder}.
\item Its constructor takes a \texttt{TranslationUnit}, i.e., the file
for which a model needs to be created.
\item The \texttt{parse} method return a Map taking
\texttt{ICElement}s to \texttt{CElementInfo}s, which contains all of the
elements that should appear in the Outline for the translation unit
specified in the constructor.  Use can either reuse the various implementations
of \texttt{ICElement} in the CDT (\texttt{Macro, Namespace,
FunctionDeclaration,} etc.), or you can create your own (with their own
icons) by implementing \texttt{IAdditionalLanguageElement}.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\item In the constructor for your editor, use the CDT UI plug-in's document
provider rather than your own, i.e.,
\begin{verbatim}
setDocumentProvider(CUIPlugin.getDefault().getDocumentProvider());
\end{verbatim}

\item Since you don't have your own document provider anymore, set up
your partitioner by overriding
\begin{verbatim}
protected void doSetInput(IEditorInput input)
\end{verbatim}
and setting it up there.

\item Reuse the Outline page provided by CDT by copying the following
field and methods from \texttt{FortranEditor} into
your editor (notice that we are passing \texttt{null} into the
constructor for \texttt{CEditorOutlinePage}; this doesn't seem to hurt
anything):
\begin{verbatim}
    protected CContentOutlinePage fOutlinePage;

    public Object getAdapter(Class required) { ... }

    public CContentOutlinePage getOutlinePage() { ... }

    public static void setOutlinePageInput(CContentOutlinePage page,
            IEditorInput input) { ... }
\end{verbatim}

\item If you want your editor to jump to the correct location when something
is selected in the Outline view, it needs to implement
\texttt{ISelectionChangedListener}.  (If you don't require this, remove
the line ``\texttt{fOutlinePage.addSelectionChangedListener(this);}''
from the code copied above.)  We implemented \texttt{ISelectionChangedListener}
by copying the following methods verbatim from \texttt{CEditor}:
\begin{verbatim}
    public void selectionChanged(SelectionChangedEvent event) { ... }

    private boolean isActivePart() { ... }

    public void setSelection(ISourceRange element, boolean moveCursor) { ... }
\end{verbatim}

\item If you want to be able to set breakpoints in your editor, add this
line to the constructor for your editor class:
\begin{verbatim}
    // JO: This gives you a "Toggle Breakpoint" action (and others)
    // when you right-click the Fortran editor's ruler
    setRulerContextMenuId("#CEditorRulerContext"); //$NON-NLS-1$
\end{verbatim}

\item If you want the CDT's Refactor menu to appear in your editor, add this
line to the constructor for your editor class:
\begin{verbatim}
    // JO: This will put the Refactor menu in the editor's
    // context menu, among other things
    setEditorContextMenuId("#CEditorContext"); //$NON-NLS-1$
\end{verbatim}

\end{itemize}

\section{Photran-CDT Integration}

Photran is integrated into the CDT in the same way described above.
\begin{itemize}

\item The Photran Core plug-in
defines a class \texttt{FortranLanguage}, which implements
\texttt{IAdditionalLanguage}, and hooks it into the (new)
\texttt{AdditionalLanguages} extension point in the CDT core.

\item Photran's Core plugin.xml defines a content type
\texttt{org.eclipse.photran.core.fortranSource}; \texttt{FortranLanguage}
notifies the CDT that we want it to treat this content type as a valid
source language.

\item We provide a \texttt{FortranModelBuilder}, which
runs our Fortran parser over a source file to create a CDT-compatible
model.

\begin{itemize}

\item Rather than using the CDT's model elements, we provide our own
model elements, which are all subclasses of \texttt{FortranElement}.
(\texttt{FortranElement} implements \texttt{IAdditionalLanguageElement}.)

\item The icons corresponding to \texttt{FortranElement}s
are stored in the org.eclipse.photran.modelicons plug-in.\footnote{
The Photran UI plug-in would be the logical place to store these icons.
However, the UI already has the Core as a dependency.  The icon requests
come from the \texttt{FortranElement}s in the Core, so if they had to be
retrieved from the UI, we would introduce a circular dependency.  So we put
them in their own plug-in.}

\end{itemize}

\item The Core plug-in also contributes several error parsers,
which are described in the next section.

\end{itemize}
