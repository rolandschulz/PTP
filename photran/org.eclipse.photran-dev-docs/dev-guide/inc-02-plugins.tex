% Plug-in Decomposition

Photran is actually a collection of several Eclipse plug-ins.
The following projects comprise Photran as it is distributed to users.

\begin{itemize}

\item org.eclipse.photran-feature

	This is the Eclipse feature for Photran, used to build the Zip
	file distributed to users.  (A feature is a grouping of related
	plug-ins.)

\item org.eclipse.photran.cdtinterface

	This contains all of the components (core and user interface) related
	to integration with the CDT.  It includes
	\begin{itemize}
	\item ILanguage for Fortran (i.e., the means
              of adding Fortran to the list of languages recognized
              by the CDT)
	\item Fortran model builder, model elements, and icons for the Outline and Projects views
	\item Fortran perspective, Fortran Projects view, and new project wizards
	\end{itemize}

\item org.eclipse.photran.core

	This is the Photran Core plug-in.  It
	contains most of the Fortran-specific ``behind the scenes'' functionality:
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Utility classes
	\item Error parsers for Fortran compilers
	\item Fortran 95 parser
	\item Workspace preferences
	\end{itemize}

\item org.eclipse.photran.core.analysis

	Beginnings of analysis support (scope, bindings, etc.) for Fortran, mainly as a basis
	for refactoring.

\item org.eclipse.photran.managedbuilder.core,
      org.eclipse.photran.managedbuilder.gnu.ui,
      org.eclipse.photran.managedbuilder.ui

	Support for Managed Build projects using the GNU toolchain.
	Managed by Craig Rasmussen at LANL.

\item org.eclipse.photran.core.intel,
      org.eclipse.photran.intel-feature,
      org.eclipse.photran.managedbuilder.intel.ui

	Support for Managed Build projects using Intel toolchains.
	Maintained by Intel.

\item org.eclipse.photran.refactoring.core,
      org.eclipse.photran.refactoring.ui,
      org.eclipse.photran.refactoring-feature

	Support for refactoring Fortran.  In progress.

\item org.eclipse.photran.ui

	This contains the Fortran-specific components of the user interface:
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Editor
	\item Preference pages
	\end{itemize}

\noindent The following projects contain JUnit tests for like-named
plug-ins, but they are not included in the actual Photran distribution:

\item org.eclipse.photran.cdtinterface.tests
\item org.eclipse.photran.core.tests
\item org.eclipse.photran.refactoring.tests

\noindent The following projects are in CVS but are not included directly in the
Photran distribution:

\item org.eclipse.photran-dev-docs

	Photran developer documentation.
	Contains the LaTeX source for this document, the materials from our
	presentation at EclipseCon 2006 on adding a new language to the CDT,
	and various other documentation notes.

\item org.eclipse.photran-misc

	No longer relevant.

\end{itemize}
