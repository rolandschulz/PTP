\begin{enumerate}

\item Run Photran's automated test suite.  All tests must pass.

\item If you are contributing a refactoring, program analysis, or similar
      complex feature, please include JUnit tests in your contribution.
      The parser and AST inevitably change over time, and this is how we will
      determine whether or not a change has broken your contribution.

\item Make sure you did not copy code from anywhere except Photran and CDT.
      If you copied code from books, mailing lists, Web sites, any other open
      source projects, other projects at your company, etc., \textbf{stop}
      and ask for further instructions.  (If you do not know a Photran
      committer personally, ask on the photran-dev mailing list.)  It may
      or may not be possible to contribute your code.

\item Determine who owns the copyright to your code.  Generally,
      if you are an employee and you were paid to write the code, it is
      the property of your employer.  If you are a student, the code may
      be your personal property, or it may be the property of your
      university, depending on several factors.  Always check with your
      employer or university to determine who the copyright owner is.
      The following examples assume that the code was written by John
      Doe as an employee of the XYZ Corporation.

\item Your code must be contributed under the terms of the Eclipse Public
      License (EPL).  If the copyright is owned by your employer or
      university, make sure they will permit you to contribute your code
      under the EPL.  (They will probably be asked for verification by
      the Eclipse Legal team.)

\item Ensure that \textit{every} Java file you created or modified has an
accurate copyright header.

    \begin{itemize}

    \item If you created the file from scratch (i.e., it is not a modification
          of someone else's code), the copyright header must name the copyright
          owner and list them as the initial contributor.  For example: \\
          
          {\scriptsize
          \begin{verbatim}
/*******************************************************************************
 * Copyright (c) 2010 XYZ Corporation and others.
 * All rights reserved. This program and the accompanying materials
 * are made available under the terms of the Eclipse Public License v1.0
 * which accompanies this distribution, and is available at
 * http://www.eclipse.org/legal/epl-v10.html
 *
 * Contributors:
 *    John Doe (XYZ Corporation) - Initial API and implementation
 *******************************************************************************/
          \end{verbatim}
          }

    \item If you modified an existing file from Photran or CDT, it must retain the
          \textit{original} copyright notice, but you should add yourself as a
          contributor at the bottom.  For example: \\
          
          {\scriptsize
          \begin{verbatim}
/*******************************************************************************
 * Copyright (c) 2004, 2008 IBM Corporation and others.
 * All rights reserved. This program and the accompanying materials
 * are made available under the terms of the Eclipse Public License v1.0
 * which accompanies this distribution, and is available at
 * http://www.eclipse.org/legal/epl-v10.html
 *
 * Contributors:
 *    IBM - Initial API and implementation
 *    John Doe (XYZ Corporation) - Photran modifications
 *******************************************************************************/
          \end{verbatim}
          }

    \end{itemize}

\item Every Java class should have a JavaDoc comment with a brief description
      of the class and an \texttt{@author} tag with your full name.  Again,
      if you modified an existing class, add an \texttt{@author} tag with your
      name.  For example:
      
      {\scriptsize
      \begin{verbatim}
/**
 * Refactoring which creates getter and setter subprograms for a module variable and replaces
 * variable accesses with calls to those subprograms.
 * <p>
 * This refactoring accepts a module variable declaration, makes that declaration PRIVATE, adds
 * getter and setter procedures to the module, and then replaces accesses to the variable outside
 * the module with calls to the getter and setter routines.
 *
 * @author Tim Yuvashev
 * @author Jeff Overbey
 */
public class EncapsulateVariableRefactoring
{ ...
      \end{verbatim}
      }

\item Create a new bug in Bugzilla on one of the ``Photran'' components.  You
can do this by clicking the ``Report a Bug'' link on the Photran home page.
If your code adds a new feature (rather than fixing a bug), set the severity
of the bug to ``Enhancement.''

\item Create a patch with the files that you changed. Ê(Highlight all of
the projects you changed in the Package Explorer, right-click, and
choose Team $>$ Create Patch.) ÊAttach the patch to the bug in Bugzilla.
ÊIf you have any binary files (e.g., images), DO NOT include them in
the patch; attach them to Bugzilla separately.

\item A Photran committer will review the code and may ask you to make changes.
If so, you will need to create a new patch, attach it to the bug, and mark the
old patch as ``obsolete.''

\item When the code review succeeds, the Photran committer will make the following
comment on the bug: \\
\ \\
{\footnotesize\itshape
\begin{minipage}{5.5in}
Please confirm that
\begin{enumerate}
\item you wrote 100\% of the code without incorporating content from elsewhere or relying on the intellectual property of others,
\item you have the right to contribute the code to Eclipse, and
\item you have included the EPL license header in all source files?
\end{enumerate}
\end{minipage}
} \\
\ \\
You can reply with something as simple as the following.
\ \\
{\footnotesize\itshape
\begin{minipage}{5.5in}
I confirm that
\begin{enumerate}
\item I wrote 100\% of the code without incorporating content from elsewhere or relying on the intellectual property of others,
\item I have the right to contribute the code to Eclipse, and
\item I have included the EPL license header in all source files.
\end{enumerate}
\end{minipage}
} \\
\ \\
However, if you \textit{did} incorporate content from elsewhere -- e.g., if your
contribution is based on code from CDT or elsewhere -- DO NOT copy-and-paste this
directly; change the first statement to note this explicitly.

\item Your code will be passed on to the intellectual property (IP) team at the
Eclipse Foundation for a legal review.  If there are any questions or concerns
about the code, a member of the Eclipse IP team will contact you.

\item Once it passes IP review, the committer will commit your code to Photran's CVS repository.

\item Your name will be added on the ``Contributors'' page of the Photran Web site.

\end{enumerate}
