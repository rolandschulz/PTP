\section{Photran Subversion Repository at UIUC}

A private Subversion repository for internal testing and research work is
provided by TSG at the following URL.  \textit{You will only be able to access
this repository if you have specifically been granted access.}  The repository
requires authentication using your NetID and Kerberos password.
To access a Subversion repository from Eclipse, you must install an additional
Eclipse plug-in (either Subclipse or Subversive).

\end{verbatim}
\end{center}

Currently, this repository contains the following.

\begin{itemize}

\item
\textbf{Large Fortran test codes (photran-projects).}
Checking these out into your workspace will enable about 6,000 additional
test cases in the JUnit test suite.  \textit{These applications are PRIVATE.
They may NOT be distributed and are intended only for testing Photran.}

\item
\textbf{Sample Obfuscation refactoring (sample-refactoring).}
The sample refactoring described in Appendix~\ref{app:obfuscate_refactoring}.

\item
\textbf{Refactoring tools for PHP, Lua, and BC.}
Prototype Eclipse-based refactoring tools based on the Rephraser Engine.

%\item
%\textbf{C preprocessor support (c-preprocessor).}
%C preprocessor support, based on the C preprocessor in CDT 5.  This will
%eventually be moved into the public CVS repository.

\end{itemize}
