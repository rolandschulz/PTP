% Running Photran's Automated Test Suite

The basic procedure for running Photran's automated test suite is described in the previous
appendix as part of the procedure for checking out Photran's source code from CVS.  In particular,
\begin{itemize}
\item the test suite is run as a JUnit 3 plug-in test,
\item assertions are enabled, and
\item a TESTING environment variable is set, which (among other things) places the VPG in a testing
      mode.
\end{itemize}

This appendix explains some of the additional options that are available when running the test suite.

\section{Enabling Fortran Compilation and Run Comparison}

Some of Photran's refactoring unit tests can attempt to compile and run the Fortran test programs
before and after the refactoring in order to ensure that the refactoring actually preserves behavior
(and produces code that compiles).

To enable this behavior,
\begin{itemize}
\item Open the run configuration for the test suite, and switch to the Environment tab.
\item Add environment variables similar to the following: \\
  \begin{tabular}{ll}
  \texttt{COMPILER} & \texttt{/usr/local/bin/gfortran} \\
  \texttt{EXECUTABLE} & \texttt{/Users/joverbey/a.out} \\
  \end{tabular} \\
\end{itemize}
The COMPILER environment variable should give the path to gfortran.  When gfortran is run, the
compiled Fortran program will be written to the file specified by the EXECUTABLE environment
variable.

When both of these environment variables are set, you will be able to see the output from the
compiler and the Fortran program in the Console view.  If compilation fails, or if the Fortran
program exits with a nonzero status code, or if the Fortran program does not produce the same output
before and after refactoring, the JUnit test will fail.

See RefactoringTestCase#compileAndRunFortranProgram for more details.

\section{Enabling Additional Parser/Source Reproduction Tests}

UIUC personnel may check out additional projects from a private Subversion repository at UIUC to
enable additional parser and source reproduction tests.  This is described in more detail in the
appendix \textit{Additional Information for UIUC Personnel.}
