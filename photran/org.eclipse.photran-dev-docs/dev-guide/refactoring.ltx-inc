\section{Introduction}

A refactoring is a program transformation to improve the quality of the source
code by making it easier to understand and modify. A refactoring is a special
kind of transformation because it preserves the \emph{observable behavior} of
your program -- it neither removes nor adds any functionality.\footnote{For more
information see
\href{http://www.amazon.com/Refactoring-Improving-Existing-Addison-Wesley-Technology/dp/0201485672}{Refactoring:
Improving the Design of Existing Code}}.

As mentioned in Chapter~\ref{cha:introduction}, the purpose in writing
Photran was to create a refactoring tool for Fortran. Because Photran is
structured as a plug-in for Eclipse, we can take advantage and reuse many of the
language-neutral support that Eclipse provides for refactoring. This makes it
possible to create refactoring tools that \emph{resemble} the Java Development
Tools that most Eclipse programmers are already familiar with.

However, implementing first-class support for Fortran refactoring is not an easy
task. It requires having an accurate representation of the underlying Fortran
source files so that our tools can perform proper program analysis to construct
our automated refactoring. The VPG (see Chapter~\ref{cha:parsing}) is our
initial step in providing such a representation; the VPG will be improved in
future versions of Photran to provide support for many different types of
refactoring and program analysis.

In this chapter, we describe how to add automated refactorings for Fortran using
the underlying infrastructure provided by Eclipse (and Photran) as well as the
analysis tools provided by the VPG.

\section{Structure of a Fortran Refactoring}
\label{sec:structure_of_a_fortran_refactoring}

Refactorings in Photran are subclassed from either
\texttt{SingleFileFortranRefactoring} or \texttt{MultipleFileFortranRefactoring}.
Both of these are subclasses of \texttt{AbstractFortranRefactoring}, which
is in turn a subclass of the \texttt{Refactoring} class provided by the Eclipse
Language ToolKit (LTK)\footnote{See
\href{http://www.eclipse.org/articles/Article-LTK/ltk.html}{The Language
Toolkit: An API for Automated Refactorings in Eclipse-based IDEs} for an
introduction to the LTK.}.

The LTK is a language-neutral API for supporting refactorings in the Eclipse
environment. It provides a generic framework to support the following
functionalities:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Invoking the refactoring from the user interface (UI).
	\item Presenting the user with a wizard to step through the refactoring.
	\item Presenting the user with a preview of the changes to be made.
\end{enumerate}

In other words, the LTK provides a common UI for refactorings: This allows
refactorings for Java, C/C++, and Fortran to all have the same look and feel.

A concrete Fortran refactoring must implement the following \emph{four} methods:
\\
\begin{code}
\begin{lstlisting}[numbers=none]
public abstract String getName();

protected abstract void doCheckInitialConditions(RefactoringStatus status,
	IProgressMonitor pm) throws PreconditionFailure;

protected abstract void doCheckFinalConditions(RefactoringStatus status,
	IProgressMonitor pm) throws PreconditionFailure;

protected abstract void doCreateChange(IProgressMonitor pm) throws
	CoreException, OperationCanceledException;
\end{lstlisting}
\caption{Abstract methods of \texttt{AbstractFortranRefactoring} class}
\label{lst:FortranRefactoring_API}
\end{code}

\texttt{getName} simply returns the name of the refactoring: ``Rename,''
``Extract Subroutine,'' ``Introduce Implicit None,'' or something similar. This
name will be used in the title of the wizard that is displayed to the user.

Initial conditions are checked before any wizard is displayed to the user. An
example would be making sure that the user has selected an identifier to rename.
If the check fails, a \texttt{PreconditionFailure} should be thrown with a
message describing the problem for the user.

Final conditions are checked after the user has provided any input. An example
would be making sure that the new name that that user has provided is a legal
identifier.

The actual transformation is done in the \texttt{doCreateChange} method, which
will be called only after the final preconditions are checked. For more information, see Section~\ref{sec:ast_rewriting}.

The \texttt{AbstractFortranRefactoring} class provides a large number of
\texttt{protected} utility methods common among refactorings, such as a method
to determine if a token is a uniquely-bound identifier, a method to parse
fragments of code that are not complete programs, and a \texttt{fail} method
which is simply shorthand for throwing a \texttt{PreconditionFailure}. It is
worth reading through the source code for \texttt{AbstractFortranRefactoring} before
writing your own utility methods.

\section{Creating Changes: AST Rewriting}
\label{sec:ast_rewriting}

After determining the files that are affected and the actual changes that are
required for a particular refactoring, manipulating the source code in the
\texttt{doCreateChange} method is conceptually straightforward.

Instead of manipulating the text in the files directly (by doing a textual find
\& replace) we use a more scalable approach: manipulating the Abstract Syntax
Tree (AST) of the source code. This allows us to make changes based on the
program's semantics and its syntactic structure. This section assumes some
familiarity with the AST used in Photran. For more information about the AST,
refer to Section~\ref{sec:virtual_program_graph}.

\subsection{Common Methods for Manipulating the AST}

In the following paragraphs, we describe some of the approaches that are
currently being used in Photran for manipulating the AST.

\subsubsection{Changing the Text of \texttt{Token}s}

To change the text of a single token, simply call its \texttt{setText} method.
This is used in \texttt{RenameRefactoring} to rename tokens while preserving the
``shape'' of the AST.
\\
\begin{code}
\begin{lstlisting}[firstnumber=273, emph={setText}]
private void makeChangesTo(IFile file, IProgressMonitor pm) throws Error
{
	try
	{
    vpg.acquirePermanentAST(file);
   
    if (definitionToRename.getTokenRef().getFile().equals(file))
        definitionToRename.getTokenRef().findToken().setText(newName);
   
    for (PhotranTokenRef ref : allReferences)
        if (ref.getFile().equals(file))
            ref.findToken().setText(newName);
   
    addChangeFromModifiedAST(file, pm);
   
    vpg.releaseAST(file);
	}
	catch (Exception e)
	{
		throw new Error(e);
	}
}	
\end{lstlisting}
\caption{Use of \texttt{setText} in \texttt{RenamingRefactoring} (see
RenameRefactoring.java)}
\end{code}

\subsubsection{Removing/replacing AST Nodes}
\label{ssub:removing_replacing_AST}

To remove or replace part of an AST, call \texttt{replaceChild},
\texttt{removeFromTree} or \texttt{replaceWith} on the node itself. These 
methods are defined in the \texttt{IASTNode} interface that all nodes implement. 
Line 107 of Listing~\ref{lst:introimplicitnone_doChange} shows an example of the
\texttt{removeFromTree} method.
\\

\begin{code}
\begin{lstlisting}[firstnumber=7236]
public static interface IASTNode
{
	void replaceChild(IASTNode node, IASTNode withNode);
	void removeFromTree();
	void replaceWith(IASTNode newNode);
	...
}
\end{lstlisting}
\caption{AST manipulation methods in \texttt{IASTNode} (see Parser.java) that
all AST nodes implement}
\end{code}

In addition, if the \emph{specific} type of the AST is known, then it is
possible to just call its \emph{setter} method to directly replace particular
nodes. For more information on the available setters for each node type, see
Section~\ref{sub:ordinary_ast_nodes}.

\subsubsection{Inserting new AST Nodes} 

Some refactorings require inserting new AST nodes into the current program. For
instance, the ``Intro Implicit None Refactoring'' inserts new declaration
statements to make the type of each variable more explicit.

There are \emph{three} steps involved in inserting a new AST node:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Constructing the new AST node.
	\item Inserting the new AST node into the correct place.
	\item Re-indenting the new AST node to fit within the current file.
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Constructing the new AST node} The \texttt{AbstractFortranRefactoring} class
provides convenience methods for constructing new AST nodes. These methods
should be treated as part of the API for Fortran refactorings . For instance,
the \texttt{parseLiteralStatement} methods constructs a list of AST nodes for 
use in the ``Intro Implicit None'' refactoring.

\paragraph{Inserting the new AST node} Inserting the new AST node can be
accomplished using the approach discussed previously in \emph{Removing/replacing AST Nodes}.

\paragraph{Re-indenting the new AST node} It might be necessary to re-indent the
newly inserted AST node so that it conforms with the indentation at its
insertion point. The \texttt{Reindenter} utility class provides the static
method \texttt{reindent} to perform this task. Refer to line 111 of
Listing~\ref{lst:introimplicitnone_doChange}.
\\

\begin{code}
\begin{lstlisting}[firstnumber=95,
emph={removeFromTree, addChangeFromModifiedAST, Reindenter}]
protected void doCreateChange(IProgressMonitor progressMonitor) throws 
CoreException, OperationCanceledException
{
	assert this.selectedScope != null;
	
	for (ScopingNode scope : selectedScope.getAllContainedScopes())
	{
		if (!scope.isImplicitNone() 
			&& !(scope instanceof ASTExecutableProgramNode) 
			&& !(scope instanceof ASTDerivedTypeDefNode))
		{
			ASTImplicitStmtNode implicitStmt = findExistingImplicitStatement(scope);
			if (implicitStmt != null) implicitStmt.removeFromTree();
	        
			IASTListNode<IBodyConstruct> newDeclarations = constructDeclarations(scope);
			scope.getBody().addAll(0, newDeclarations);
			Reindenter.reindent(newDeclarations, astOfFileInEditor);
		}
	}
			
	this.addChangeFromModifiedAST(this.fileInEditor, progressMonitor);
	vpg.releaseAllASTs();
}	
\end{lstlisting}
\caption{Inserting new declarations into an existing scope
(see \texttt{IntroImplicitNoneRefactoring.java})}
\label{lst:introimplicitnone_doChange}
\end{code}

\subsection{Committing Changes}

After all of the changes have been made to a file's AST,
\texttt{addChangeFromModifiedAST} has to be invoked to actually
commit the changes. This convenience function creates a new
\texttt{TextFileChange} for the \emph{entire} content of the file. The
underlying Eclipse infrastructure performs a \texttt{diff} internally to
determine what parts have actually changed and present those changes to the user
in the preview dialog.

\section{Caveats}
\label{sec:refactoring_caveats}

\textbf{CAUTION:} Internally, the AST is changed only enough to reproduce
correct source code. After making changes to an AST, most of the accessor
methods on \texttt{Token}s (\texttt{getLine(), getOffset(),} etc.) will return
\textit{incorrect} or \emph{null} values.

Therefore, \textit{all program analysis should be done first}; pointers to all
relevant \textbf{tokens} should be obtained (usually as \texttt{TokenRef}s)
\textit{prior} to making any modifications to the AST. In general, ensure that
all analysis (and storing of important information from \texttt{Token}s) should
be done in the \texttt{doCheckInitialConditions} and
\texttt{doCheckFinalConditions} methods of your refactoring before the
\texttt{doCreateChange} method.

\vspace{-0.2in}
\subsection{\texttt{Token} or \texttt{TokenRef}?}
\label{sub:token_or_tokenref}

\texttt{Token}s form the leaves of the AST -- therefore they exist as part of
the Fortran AST. Essentially this means that holding on to a reference to a
\texttt{Token} object requires the entire AST to be present in memory.

\texttt{TokenRef}s are lightweight descriptions of tokens in an AST. They
contain only three fields: filename, offset and length. These three fields
uniquely identify a particular token in a file. Because they are not part of the
AST, storing a \texttt{TokenRef} does not require the entire AST to be present
in memory.

For most refactorings, using either \texttt{Token}s or \texttt{TokenRef}s does
not make much of a difference. However, in a refactoring like ``Rename
Refactoring'' that could potentially modify hundreds of files, it is impractical
to store all ASTs in memory at once. Because of the complexity of the Fortran
language itself, its ASTs can be rather large and complex. Therefore storing
references to \texttt{TokenRef}s would minimize the number of ASTs that must be
in memory.

To retrieve an actual \texttt{Token} from a \texttt{TokenRef}, call the
\texttt{findToken()} method in \texttt{PhotranTokenRef}, a subclass
of \texttt{TokenRef}.

To create a \texttt{TokenRef} from an actual \texttt{Token}, call the \texttt{getTokenRef} method in \texttt{Token}.

\vspace{-0.2in}
\section{Examples}

The ``Rename'', ``Introduce Implicit None'' and ``Move COMMON To Module''
refactorings found in the \texttt{org.eclipse.photran.internal.core.refactoring}
package inside the \texttt{org.eclipse.photran.core.vpg} project are
non-trivial but readable and should serve as a model for building future Fortran
refactorings.

An example of a simpler but rather \emph{useless} refactoring is presented in
Appendix~\ref{app:obfuscate_refactoring}. It should be taken as a guide on the
actual steps that are involved in registering a new refactoring with the UI and
also how to actually construct a working Fortran refactoring.

\section{Common Tasks}

In this section, we briefly summarize some of the common tasks involved in
writing a new Fortran refactoring.

\noindent \textbf{In an AST, how do I find an ancestor node that is of a
particular type?}
\\ Sometimes it might be necessary to traverse the AST \emph{upwards} to look
for an ancestor node of a particular type. Instead of traversing the AST
manually, you should call the \texttt{findNearestAncestor(TargetASTNode.class)}
method on a \texttt{Token} and pass it the \textbf{class} of the ASTNode that
you are looking for.

\noindent \textbf{How would I create a new AST node from a string?} 
\\ Call the \texttt{parseLiteralStatement(String string)} or
\texttt{parseLiteralStatementSequence(String string)} method in
\texttt{AbstractFortranRefactoring}. The former takes a \texttt{String} that represents
a single statement while the latter takes a \texttt{String} that represents a
sequence of statements.

\noindent \textbf{How do I print the text of an AST node and all its children
nodes?}
\\ Call the \texttt{SourcePrinter.getSourceCodeFromASTNode(IASTNode node)}
method. This method returns a \texttt{String} representing the source code of
its parameter; it includes the user's comments, capitalization and whitespace.
