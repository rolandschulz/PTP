\section{The Photran Feature}

The following projects comprise the ``base'' of Photran.
All sources in these projects are Java 4.

\begin{itemize}

\item org.eclipse.photran-feature

	This is the Eclipse feature for Photran, used to build the Zip
	file distributed to users.  (A feature is a grouping of related
	plug-ins.)

\item org.eclipse.photran.cdtinterface

	This contains all of the components (core and user interface) related
	to integration with the CDT.  It includes
	\begin{itemize}
	\item ILanguage for Fortran (i.e., the means
              of adding Fortran to the list of languages recognized
              by the CDT)
	\item Fortran model elements, and icons for the Outline and Projects views
	\item Simple lexical analyzer-based model builder, and an extension
	      point for contributing more sophisticated model builders
	\item Fortran perspective, Fortran Projects view, and new project wizards
	\end{itemize}

\item org.eclipse.photran.core

	This is the Photran Core plug-in.  It contains much of the
	Fortran-specific ``behind the scenes'' functionality:
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Utility classes
	\item Error parsers for Fortran compilers
	\item Fortran 95 lexical analyzer
	\item Workspace preferences
	\end{itemize}

\item org.eclipse.photran.core.errorparsers.xlf

	Error parser for the XLF compiler.
	Managed by Craig Rasmussen at LANL.

\item org.eclipse.photran.managedbuilder.core,
      org.eclipse.photran.managedbuilder.gnu.ui,
      org.eclipse.photran.managedbuilder.xlf.ui,
      org.eclipse.photran.managedbuilder.ui

	Support for Managed Build projects using the GNU toolchain.
	Managed by Craig Rasmussen at LANL.

\item org.eclipse.photran.core.intel,
      org.eclipse.photran.intel-feature,
      org.eclipse.photran.managedbuilder.intel.ui

	Support for Managed Build projects using Intel toolchains.
	Maintained by Bill Hilliard at Intel.

\item org.eclipse.photran.ui

	This contains the Fortran-specific components of the user interface:
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Editor
	\item Preference pages
	\end{itemize}

\section{The Virtual Program Graph (VPG) Feature: Analysis and Refactoring Support}

The following projects support parsing, analysis, and refactoring of Fortran sources.
They are written in Java 5.
The Virtual Program Graph is described in more detail later.

\item org.eclipse.photran.vpg.core

	This contains the parsing, analysis, and refactoring infrastructure.
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Fortran parser and abstract syntax tree (AST)
	\item Fortran preprocessor (to handle INCLUDE lines)
	\item Parser-based model builder
	\item Virtual Program Graph library (vpg-eclipse.jar)
	\item Photran's Virtual Program Graph (VPG)
	\item Utility classes (e.g., \texttt{SemanticError}, \texttt{LineCol})
	\item Project property pages
	\item Binding analysis (equivalent to symbol tables)
	\item Type checker (incomplete)
	\item Refactoring/program transformation engine
	\item Refactorings
	\end{itemize}

\item org.eclipse.photran.core.vpg.tests

	JUnit Plug-in tests for the VPG core plug-in.

\item org.eclipse.photran.ui.vpg

	UI contributions that depend on the org.eclipse.photran.core.vpg plug-in.
	Currently, this is the
	Open Declaration action,
	a project property page where the user can customize the search path for Fortran modules and include files,
	and all of the actions in the Refactoring menu.

\section{Other Plug-ins}

The following projects are in CVS but are not distributed to users:

\item org.eclipse.photran-dev-docs

    Developer documentation, including this document
    (\texttt{dev-guide/*}), CVS instructions
    (\texttt{dev-guide/cvs-instructions.pdf}),
	the materials from our presentation at EclipseCon 2006 on adding a new
	language to the CDT, and a spreadsheet
    mapping features in the Fortran language to JUnit tests
    (\texttt{language-coverage/*}).

\item org.eclipse.photran-samples

	A Photran project containing an assortment of Fortran code.

\end{itemize}
