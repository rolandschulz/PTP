\begin{list}{$\bigcirc$}{}

\item \textbf{Install Photran, read its documentation, and become a proficient user.}
Generally speaking, you cannot fix or enhance a program you don't know how to use.

\item \textbf{Check out Photran's source code from CVS and run the test suite.}
See Appendices~\ref{app:cvs} and~\ref{app:testsuite}.

\item \textbf{Join the \href{https://dev.eclipse.org/mailman/listinfo/photran-dev}{photran-dev mailing list}.}
This is where discussions about Photran's development take place. Questions from developers (like you), release planning, API changes, etc.~all get discussed here.

\item \textbf{Join the \href{https://dev.eclipse.org/mailman/listinfo/photran}{photran users' mailing list}.}
It is good to keep track of what Photran's users are discussing, and as a Photran developer you will probably be able to answer many of their questions as well.

\item \textbf{Create a Bugzilla account.}
You will need to \href{https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/createaccount.cgi}{create an account at bugs.eclipse.org} if you don't already have one. When you eventually want to contribute code to Photran, you will need to do it by attaching a patch to a Bugzilla bug.

\item \textbf{Get a book or two on Eclipse plug-in development.}
Eventually, you'll want to buy (or check out from the library) a book on Eclipse plug-in development.
\textit{The Java Developer's Guide to Eclipse} by D'Anjou et al.~is a good choice.

\item \textbf{Learn the basics of Eclipse plug-in development.}
If you get D'Anjou's book, read Chapters 7-9 and 21.
After you figure out the basics of Eclipse development (like how plugin.xml works), it's best to just start fixing bugs or adding features, returning to the book as a reference when you have something more specific you need to do.

\item \textbf{Read the Photran Developer's Guide.}
Chapters 1, 2, and 3 apply to everyone. The other chapters are more specialized; for example, the chapters on Parsing and Refactoring only apply to people developing refactorings, and the Photran Editors chapter applies mostly to people adding features to the Fortran editor.
