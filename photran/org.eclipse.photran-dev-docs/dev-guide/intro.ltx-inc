Photran is an IDE for Fortran 90/95 and Fortran 77 that is built on top of
Eclipse. It is structured as an Eclipse feature, in other words, as a set of
plug-ins that are designed to be used together. Starting with version 3.0, it is
an extension of CDT, the Eclipse IDE for C/C++. Previous versions of Photran
were created by hacking a copy of the CDT to support Fortran instead of C/C++,
but now we have developed a mechanism for adding new languages into the CDT,
allowing the Fortran support code to be in its own set of plug-ins.

Our purpose in writing Photran was to create a refactoring tool for Fortran.
Thus, Photran has a complete parser and program representation. Photran adds a
Fortran editor and several preference pages to the CDT user interface, as well
as a Fortran Managed Make project type.

This document explains the design of Photran so that interested contributors
could fix a bug or add a refactoring. Contributors should know how to use
Photran and how the CDT works. There is a short
\href{http://www.eclipse.org/photran/documentation.php}{\emph{Getting Started
Guide}} on the Photran website.

Contributors also need to understand Eclipse and Eclipse plug-ins before you
read this document. We recommend reading
\href{http://www.amazon.com/Eclipse-Building-Commercial-Quality-Plug-Ins/dp/0321228472}{\emph{Building
Commercial-Quality Plug-ins}} and
\href{http://www.amazon.com/Java-Developers-Guide-Eclipse-2nd/dp/0321305027/}{\emph{The
Java Developer's Guide to Eclipse}} for Eclipse newcomers.

This is a \emph{duplex} guide. The main chapters provide general descriptions of
the various components and how they interact. The appendix describe concrete
examples from Photran so that contributors can familiarize themselves with
actual code and implementation details.
