  + Section 9
  + Section 11
  + Section 12 (Completed 1/28/09)
  - Missing productions?
  - Semantics
  - Outline view
+ Fortran Decl View not populating when it should (12/9/08)
+ Refactorings should not work if VPG is turned off -- give appropriate error
  instead of "please select an ..." error when VPG is disabled (12/9/08)
+ Renaming outu in "write (outu, ..." doesn't work in bstfit.f90 (12/9/08)
+ Link interfaces to function definitions (12/31/08) and vice versa (1/4-5/09)
  - Include module subprograms, not just external subprograms
  - Module Procedure statements
  - Named interfaces
+ mailinglists.php -- See "Re: MySQL Error" e-mail (1/27/09)
+ CS427 - Hover tips - https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=259163 (1/29/09)
+ Stas - Move Saved to Common Block Refactoring (1/29/09)
+ NPE org.eclipse.photran.internal.ui.editor_vpg.hover.FortranDeclarationHover.getHoverInfo(FortranDeclarationHover.java:91) (1/29/09)
+ New Fortran File wizard and menu item (1/29/09) -- If I click on new source file, I can choose between a C and a C++ template or <no template>. However, there's no FORTRAN-template. This is a usability feature, I hope this is not too hard to add.
+ Refactorings should not be available for fixed form files (2/11/09) -- Created separate context menus for fixed and free form

CRITICAL:
- Preproc substring bug
- I'm having trouble getting content assist and declaration view working.  I've enabled them per the directions, but still no luck.  My vpg error log has many exceptions, one of which pointed to a line of my code: include 'constants.h'   My code compiles, but there are additional files that vpg is picking up that aren't part of my makefile, which may be causing problems.  Hence, I would like to specify directories to be excluded from analysis.
- Bug in indexing: not linking identifiers -- See Stas's description
- Link subprograms across files
- Bugs reported in MP5
- VPG omits dependencies on unnamed common blocks (?)
- NPEs in indexer -- see Bugzilla
- Bug renaming function in Arjan's libgrid.f90 (line 72/82): implicit function result variable not renamed

EVENTUAL:
- New Fortran File menu item
- Rename bug: local variable may not shadow program name
- Open Decl error message
- Persist project properties
- It is possible to get have source tarball releases as well?
- Change hasEqEqOp() to hasEqOp() in ASTOperatorNode
- Add function testing stuff
- Get rid of VarOrFnRefNode
- Should be able to parenthesize arg to subroutine
- What is /= in ASTOperatorNode?
- Multiple parsing start symbols
- No renaming of namelist variables
- Should be able to set parenthesis tokens
- Where to insert type decl stmt?  Send fn name to Stas
- Give subroutine and function parameter, subroutine and function argument, subroutine and function nodes common parents
- Parser bug: does not accept "common // a,b"
- Look at and possibly commit search patch
- Rename across interfaces, external subprograms (promised Bruno in e-mail)
- Should be able to select after last character of an identifier and still activate refactoring
- Outdated (and duplicate?) VPG error messages when not tied to an IFile
- Need view (and optional markers?) with VPG errors/warnings
