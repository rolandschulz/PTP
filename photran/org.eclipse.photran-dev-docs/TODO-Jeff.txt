NEW IN THIS BETA:
- Find All References
- Fortran 2003
- New gfortran error parser



GRANT/SUPPORT REQUIREMENTS
- 2003 syntax (10/08 or 11/08)
+ Fix AST for expressions (for Stoyan 9/8/08)
- Include intent, etc. in definition
- Make a Type object for arrays which includes dimensions (for Stoyan)
- Parse kinds and character lengths and include in Type


FOR NEXT BETA
- Preproc substring bug
- Open Decl error message
- Persist project properties
- New Fortran file wizard and menu item
- I'm having trouble getting content assist and declaration view working.  I've enabled them per the directions, but still no luck.  My vpg error log has many exceptions, one of which pointed to a line of my code: include 'constants.h'   My code compiles, but there are additional files that vpg is picking up that aren't part of my makefile, which may be causing problems.  Hence, I would like to specify directories to be excluded from analysis.
- If I click on new source file, I can choose between a C and a C++ template or <no template>. However, there's no FORTRAN-template. This is a usability feature, I hope this is not too hard to add.
- It is possible to get have source tarball releases as well?


- Change hasEqEqOp() to hasEqOp() in ASTOperatorNode
- Add function testing stuff
- Get rid of VarOrFnRefNode
- Should be able to parenthesize arg to subroutine
- What is /= in ASTOperatorNode?

- Refactorings should not work if VPG is turned off

- Refactoring gives "please select an ..." error when VPG is disabled

- Multiple parsing start symbols

- No renaming of namelist variables

Link interfaces to function definitions
Bug in indexing - not linking identifiers
Should be able to set parenthesis tokens
Where to insert type decl stmt?  Send fn name to Stas
Give subroutine and function parameter, subroutine and function argument, subroutine and function nodes common parents
Link subprograms across files

Parser bug: does not accept "common // a,b"

STAS'S STUFF:
Move save vars to common block
Common to composite type
Move composite type from common to local pointer
Pass that pointer around
