+ Fortran Decl View not populating when it should (12/9/08)
+ Refactorings should not work if VPG is turned off -- give appropriate error
  instead of "please select an ..." error when VPG is disabled (12/9/08)
+ Renaming outu in "write (outu, ..." doesn't work in bstfit.f90 (12/9/08)
+ Link interfaces to function definitions (12/31/08) and vice versa (1/4-5/08)
- Refactorings should not be available for fixed form files
- Rename bug: local variable may not shadow program name
- Preproc substring bug
- Open Decl error message
- Persist project properties
- New Fortran file wizard and menu item
- I'm having trouble getting content assist and declaration view working.  I've enabled them per the directions, but still no luck.  My vpg error log has many exceptions, one of which pointed to a line of my code: include 'constants.h'   My code compiles, but there are additional files that vpg is picking up that aren't part of my makefile, which may be causing problems.  Hence, I would like to specify directories to be excluded from analysis.
- If I click on new source file, I can choose between a C and a C++ template or <no template>. However, there's no FORTRAN-template. This is a usability feature, I hope this is not too hard to add.
- It is possible to get have source tarball releases as well?
- Change hasEqEqOp() to hasEqOp() in ASTOperatorNode
- Add function testing stuff
- Get rid of VarOrFnRefNode
- Should be able to parenthesize arg to subroutine
- What is /= in ASTOperatorNode?
- Multiple parsing start symbols
- No renaming of namelist variables
- Bug in indexing: not linking identifiers
- Should be able to set parenthesis tokens
- Where to insert type decl stmt?  Send fn name to Stas
- Give subroutine and function parameter, subroutine and function argument, subroutine and function nodes common parents
- Link subprograms across files
- Parser bug: does not accept "common // a,b"

- VPG omits dependencies on unnamed common blocks (?)

Stas is going to...
1. Move save vars to common block
2. Common to composite type
3. Move composite type from common to local pointer
4. Pass that pointer around
