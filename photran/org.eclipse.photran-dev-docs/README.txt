This is a C Standard Make Project.  If you have CDT installed,
you can use the make target "all" to rebuild the PDFs using
pdflatex.

Contents:

dev-guide
	Contains the Photran Developer's Guide.  The CVS
	instructions in Appendix A are also made into a
	separate PDF.
	
	If you edit this, make sure your name is added
	to authors.tex!

misc-notes
	Various notes-to-self that aren't import enough to
	be in the developer's guide.
