The Find References action was contributed by a CS427 group in Fall, 2007, and was extended by
another CS427 group in Fall, 2008, to implement Fortran Search.  Documentation for the original
Find References contribution is contained in the org.eclipse.photran-dev-docs project in the
contributions/find-references folder.
