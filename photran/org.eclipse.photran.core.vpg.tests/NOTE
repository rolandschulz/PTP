Due to licensing restrictions, some of the Fortran code used for testing
the parser cannot be made publicly available.  The corresponding JUnit
tests will display an informational message if these directories do not
exist, but no tests should fail.  (See ParseIBEAMCppMod.java for one
example of such a test.)

See the Photran Developer's Guide for more information.
