     * By the time the Rephraser Engine was built (but after about 15 refactorings
     * were built), we had established the precedent that all preconditions for
     * Fortran refactorings were protected methods inherited from a superclass.
     * In order to keep this (and avoid upsetting all the refactoring classes),
     * these methods were placed into the MultipleFileFortranRefactoring class, and
     * this class inherits from that.  Unfortunately, that means this class cannot
     * inherit from VPGEditorRefactoring, which would be more logical.  So,
     * VPGEditorRefactoring is copied into this class... which is probably OK since
     * that class will rarely, if ever, change.  A more "correct" strategy would be
     * to move all of the precondition checks into a Check class and have this
     * inherit from VPGEditorRefactoring.  We should do that eventually, but it will
     * be a fairly disruptive change...  TODO: Correct inheritance, move prec checks
