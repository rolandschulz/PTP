/**
 * This is a kludge which allows an object to be iterated through via a Java 5 foreach loop, even though it was
 * not declared as such.
 * 
 * This is useful since part of Photran is Java 1.4-compliant and part is 1.5-compliant: it allows a 1.4-compliant
 * object to be iterated through without explicitly constructing an iterator.  When Photran is moved entirely to
 * Java 1.5, these wrappers can simply be removed and the foreach loops left as-is.  If iterators were manually
 * constructed, they would have to be replaced with foreach loops manually.
