 * An extension to the IProgressMonitor interface for monitors that want to
 * support feedback when an activity is blocked due to concurrent activity in
 * another thread.
 * <p>
 * When a monitor that supports this extension is passed to an operation, the
 * operation should call <code>setBlocked</code> whenever it knows that it
 * must wait for a lock that is currently held by another thread. The operation
 * should continue to check for and respond to cancelation requests while
 * blocked. When the operation is no longer blocked, it must call <code>clearBlocked</code>
 * to clear the blocked state.
 * <p>
 * This interface can be used without OSGi running.
 * </p><p>
 * Clients may implement this interface.
