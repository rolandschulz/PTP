/**
 * A refactoring that can be applied when the user has a file open in a text/code editor.
 * <p>
 * These refactorings will be available only when the user has a file open in a text/code editor.
 * They are provided with the current selection in the editor, the assumption being that what the
 * refactoring does will depend on what the user has selected.
 * <p>
 * Contrast this with an {@link IResourceRefactoring}, which is available from the editor but is
 * also available when the user has selected one or more resources in the Navigator view; these
 * refactorings may be applied to several resources at once, and an editor selection may not be
 * available; thus, an {@link IResourceRefactoring} is expected to operate on the entire file,
 * oblivious to the current selection.
