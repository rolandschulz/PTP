<div><h1>Introduction
</h1><h2>What is Refactoring?
</h2><p><i>Refactorings
</i> are changes to a program that improve its
internal design but do not change its behavior.  These
include minor, coding style changes (like using IMPLICIT
NONE statements), code readability improvements
(like replacing a variable named N with one called
NUM_POINTS), performance improvements (like
interchanging loops under certain conditions), and
even larger-scale design changes (like moving a
procedure from one module to another).
Although these types of changes can be done by hand,
making them is often tedious and error-prone.  Photran
<i>automates</i> many such refactorings.  For example,
the Refactor &gt; Rename command can automatically
locate the declaration(s) and uses of a particular subroutine,
and change its name in all of those locations.  It is &quot;smart,&quot;
too; if there is a subroutine named <i>d</i> and a variable
named <i>d</i> in a different context, it won't confuse the
two.  Moreover, before making such a change, Photran
will attempt to <i>verify</i> that the change is safe to make.
For example, a subroutine <i>A</i> cannot be renamed to
<i>B</i> if there is already a variable named <i>B</i> in a
context where that subroutine is called.
For more information on refactoring, see
M. Fowler, <i>Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code,</i>
Addison-Wesley, 1999.
</p><h2>Refactoring in Photran
</h2><p>Most refactorings can be accessed via the Refactor menu in the
menu bar, as described below.  However, the most common
refactorings also have hotkeys (e.g., Alt+Shift+R for Rename;
hotkeys are listed in the Refactoring menu next to each command).
Also, most refactorings can be accessed by right-clicking in an
editor and choosing Refactor from the popup menu.
Some refactorings (such as Introduce Implicit None and
Replace Obsolete Operators) can be applied to several files
at once.  As described below, this involves selecting one or more
files in the Fortran Projects view, then right-clicking on any of
the selected filenames and choosing Refactor from the popup
menu.
<ul>
<li> Clicking on a filename in the Fortran Projects view selects
that file (and only that file).
<li> Ctrl+click (Command+click on Mac OS X) can be used
to select or deselect additional files.
<li> To select a range of files, click on one filename, and
Shift+click on a later filename;
those files and all of the files in between will be selected as
well.
</ul>
<i><b>Caution:</b> <b>Photran can only refactor free-format Fortran
source code.  It is not possible to refactor fixed-form code.</b>
Make sure that only free-form Fortran files
are selected.</i>  The Refactor menu may not be available if any
of the files are fixed-form or non-Fortran files.
</p><h1>Rename
</h1><p><ul>
<li><b>Description:</b> Rename is essentially a &quot;smart&quot;
search and replace: It allows you to change the name of a variable,
subprogram, etc.  It correctly observes scoping and shadowing rules
can also rename subprograms and module entities across files.
<li><b>Applies To:</b>
<ol>
<li> Local variables<sup>1,2</sup>
<li> Subprograms<sup>3</sup> (including external and interface declarations)
<li> Derived types
<li> Module entities (variables and subprograms)
<li> Main programs
<li> Namelists
<li> Common blocks
<li> Block data subprograms
</ol>
<li><b>Operation:</b>
<ol>
<li> Click on the name of a local variable, subprogram, etc.
<li> Click Refactor &gt; Rename...  The Rename dialog will appear.<br>
<center>
<img src="../images/Photran-rename-dialog.png" alt="Rename dialog"></img></center>
<li> Enter a new name for the variable/subprogram/etc.
<li> If you are renaming an external subprogram or a subprogram
declared in an interface block, you may want to (un)check the
box labeled <i>Match external subprograms with interfaces and
external declarations.</i>  If this is checked, the refactoring
will attempt to find <i>all</i> external subprograms, EXTERNAL
statements, and subprogram declarations in INTERFACE blocks that
have the given name, and they will all be renamed.
<li> Click Preview to see what changes will be made, then click OK to apply them.
</ol>
<li><b>Example:</b><br>
<center>
<img src="../images/Photran-rename-1.png" alt="Simple example of the Rename refactoring"></img></center>
</ul>
<p>
<small>1. Dummy subprogram arguments cannot be renamed</small><br>
<small>2. Components of derived types cannot be renamed</small><br>
<small>3. Intrinsic subprograms and type-bound procedures (Fortran 2003) cannot be renamed</small>
</p>
</p><h1>Encapsulate variable
</h1><p><ul>
<li><b>Description:</b> Encapsulate variable creates getter and setter methods for the selected variable
in the module where it is defined and changes variable's visibility to <b>private</b>.
It also replaces all uses of that variable in all files to use getter and setter method calls<sup>1</sup>.
<li><b>Applies To:</b>
<ol>
<li> Variables defined in the module.
<li> Variables of all basic as well as user-defined types
</ol>
<li><b>Does Not Apply To:</b>
<ol>
<li> Arrays
<li> Variables that are not defined in a module
<li> Parameters (i.e. <b>integer, parameter :: CANNOT_ENCAPSULATE</b>)
<li> Pointers (i.e. <b>real, pointer :: CANNOT_ENCAPSULATE</b>)
<li> Targes (i.e. <b>integer, target :: CANNOT_ENCAPSULATE</b>)
</ol>
<li><b>Operation:</b>
<ol>
<li> Click on or select the name of variable you want to encapsulate.
<li> Click Refactor &gt; Encapsulate Variable. The Encapsulate Variable dialog will appear.<br>
<center>
<img src="../images/GetterSetterNames.jpg" alt="Getter and setter name menu for encapsulating variable <b>temp</b>"></img></center>
<li> Enter names for getter and setter methods. You will be warned if the names that you want to assign to your getter and setter methods will be conflicting with some other identifier in any of the involved files.
<li> Click Preview to see what changes will be made, then click OK to apply them.
</ol>
<li><b>Example:</b><br>
<center>
<img src="../images/EncapsulateVariablesPart1.jpg" alt="Simple example of Encapsulate Variable refactoring<b>temp</b>"></img></center>
<br>
<center>
<img src="../images/EncapsulateVariablesPart2.jpg" alt="Simple example of Encapsulate Variable refactoring<b>temp</b>"></img></center>
</ul>
<p>
<small>1. If a variable is used as a parameter to a function/subroutine call, and that function changes
the value of the variable as a side-effect, that change will not be preserved.
</small><br>
</p>
</p><h1>Interchange loops
</h1><p><ul>
<li><b>Description:</b> Swaps inner and outer loops of the selected nested do-loop<sup>1</sup>. This refactoring merely
switches the inner and outer do-headers. It will not make any changes to the body of the loop.
<li><b>Applies To:</b> Selected nested do-loop
<li><b>Operation:</b>
<ol>
<li> Select the nested loops you wish to interchange
<li> Click Refactor &gt; Interchange Loops. The Interchange loops dialog will appear.<br>
<li> Click Preview to see what changes will be made, then click OK to apply them.
</ol>
<li><b>Example:</b><br>
<center>
<img src="../images/InterchangeLoops.png" alt="Simple example of Interchange Loops refactoring"></img></center>
</ul>
<p>
<small>1. In order for refactoring to work correctly, there must be no statements
before the second loop. If such statements exist, correctness of the
refactoring is not guaranteed.
</small>
</p>
</p><h1>Introduce Implicit None
</h1><p><ul>
<li><b>Description:</b> Adds IMPLICIT NONE statements to a file
and adds explicit declarations for all variables that were previously declared implicitly.
<li><b>Applies To:</b> All main programs, subprograms, and modules in one or more files.
<li><b>Operation:</b>
<ol>
<li> This is a multiple-file refactoring.
<ul>
<li> <i>To Introduce Implicit None in a single file,</i>
open the file in the editor and choose
Refactor &gt; Introduce Implicit None
from the menu bar.
<li> <i>To Introduce Implicit None in multiple files,</i>
select the files in the Fortran Projects view,
right-click on any of the selected filenames,
and choose
Refactor &gt; Introduce Implicit None
from the popup menu.
</ul>
<li> Click Preview to see what changes will be made, then click OK to apply them.
</ol>
<li><b>Example:</b><br>
<center>
<img src="../images/Photran-intro-implicit-1.png" alt="Example of the Introduce Implicit None refactoring"></img></center>
</ul>
</p><h1>Move Saved Variables to Common Block
</h1><p><ul>
<li><b>Description:</b> Move Saved Variables to Common Block creates a common block for all &quot;saved&quot; variables of a subprogram. Declarations of these variables in the subprogram are transformed such that they are no longer &quot;saved&quot;. The generated common block is declared both in the main PROGRAM and in the affected subprogram. Variables placed in the common block are renamed such that they do not conflict or shadow other variables. The current implementation assumes that the subprogram is in the CONTAINS section of the PROGRAM.
<li><b>Applies To:</b> Subprograms.
<li><b>Operation:</b>
<ol>
<li> Click on the declaration statement of a subprogram.
<li> Click Refactor &gt; Move Saved Variables to Common Block.
<li> Click Preview to see what changes will be made, then click OK to apply them.
</ol>
<li><b>Example:</b><br>
<center>
<img src="../images/MoveSavedToCommonBlock.PNG" alt="Example of the Introduce Implicit None refactoring"></img></center>
</ul>
</p><h1>Replace Obsolete Operators
</h1><p><ul>
<li><b>Description:</b> Replace Obsolete Operators replaces all uses of old-style
comparison operators (such as .LT. and .EQ.) with their newer equivalents
(symbols such as &lt; and ==).
and adds explicit declarations for all variables that were previously declared implicitly.
<li><b>Applies To:</b> All uses of the following operators in one or more files:
.LT. .LE. .EQ. .NE. .GT. .GE.
<li><b>Operation:</b>
<ol>
<li> This is a multiple-file refactoring.
<ul>
<li> <i>To Replace Obsolete Operators in a single file,</i>
open the file in the editor and choose
Refactor &gt; Replace Obsolete Operators
from the menu bar.
<li> <i>To Replace Obsolete Operators in multiple files,</i>
select the files in the Fortran Projects view,
right-click on any of the selected filenames,
and choose
Refactor &gt; Replace Obsolete Operators
from the popup menu.
</ul>
<li> Click Preview to see what changes will be made, then click OK to apply them.
</ol>
<li><b>Example:</b><br>
<center>
<img src="../images/Photran-replace-obsolete-1.png" alt="Example of the Replace Obsolete Operators refactoring"></img></center>
</ul>
</p><h1>Standardize Statements
</h1><p><ul>
<li><b>Description:</b> Standardize Statements rewrites all variables declarations, so that
<ul>
<li>there is only one variable declaration per line, and
<li>every variable declaration contains a double colon (::).
</ul> This is intended to make the code more readable.
<li><b>Applies To:</b> All main programs, subprograms, and modules in one or more files.
<li><b>Operation:</b>
<ol>
<li> This is a multiple-file refactoring.
<ul>
<li> <i>To Standardize Statements in a single file,</i>
open the file in the editor and choose
Refactor &gt; Standardize Statements
from the menu bar.
<li> <i>To Standardize Statements in multiple files,</i>
select the files in the Fortran Projects view,
right-click on any of the selected filenames,
and choose
Refactor &gt; Standardize Statements
from the popup menu.
</ul>
<li> Click Preview to see what changes will be made, then click OK to apply them.
</ol>
<li><b>Example:</b><br>
<center>
<img src="../images/Photran-Standardize-Statements.png" alt="Example of the Standardize Statements refactoring"></img></center>
</ul>
</p><h1>Remove Unused Variables
</h1><p><ul>
<li><b>Description:</b> Remove Unused Variables removes declarations of local variables that are never used.
<li><b>Applies To:</b> All main programs, subprograms, and modules in one or more files.
<li><b>Operation:</b>
<ol>
<li> This is a multiple-file refactoring.
<ul>
<li> <i>To Remove Unused Variables in a single file,</i>
open the file in the editor and choose
Refactor &gt; Remove Unused Variables
from the menu bar.
<li> <i>To Remove Unused Variables in multiple files,</i>
select the files in the Fortran Projects view,
right-click on any of the selected filenames,
and choose
Refactor &gt; Remove Unused Variables
from the popup menu.
</ul>

</ol>
<li><b>Example:</b><br>
<center>
<img src="../images/Photran-Remove-Unused-Variables.png" alt="Example of the Remove Unused Variables refactoring"></img></center>
</ul>
</p><h1>Data to Parameter
</h1><p><ul>
<li><b>Description:</b> When a variable declared in a DATA statement is intended to be a constant, Data to Parameter can be used to change it to a variable with the PARAMETER attribute.  Using the PARAMETER attribute makes it more clear which variables are constants and which ones are not; it can also result in performance gains, since it may allow an optimizing compiler to replace some variable accesses with the constant value.
<li><b>Applies To:</b> All main programs, subprograms, and modules in one or more files.
<li><b>Operation:</b>
<ol>
<li> This is a multiple-file refactoring.
<ul>
<li> <i>To transform variables declared as data in variables declared with parameter attribute in a single file,</i>
open the file in the editor and choose
Refactor &gt; Data To Parameter
from the menu bar.
<li> <i>To transform variables declared as data in variables declared with parameter attribute in multiple files,</i>
select the files in the Fortran Projects view,
right-click on any of the selected filenames,
and choose
Refactor &gt; Data To Parameter
from the popup menu.
</ul>
<li> Click Preview to see what changes will be made, then click OK to apply them.
</ol>
<li><b>Example:</b><br>

<img src="../images/Photran-Data-To-Parameter.png" alt="Example of the Data To Parameter refactoring"></img></center>
</ul>
</p><h1>Extract Procedure
</h1><p><ul>
<li><b>Description:</b> Extract Procedure removes a sequence of statements from a procedure,
places them into a new subroutine, and replaces the original statements with a call to that
subroutine.  Any local variables used by those statements will be passed as parameters to
the new procedure.  This refactoring is generally used to make long procedures shorter.
<li><b>Applies To:</b> A sequence of one or more action statements inside a procedure or main program.
<li><b>Operation:</b>
<ol>
<li> Select a sequence of one or more action statements in the editor.  Be sure to include the
newline following the last statement in the selection.
<li> Click Refactor &gt; Extract Procedure...  The Extract Procedure dialog will appear.<br>
<center>
<img src="../images/Photran-extract-proc-dialog.png" alt="Extract Procedure dialog"></img></center>
<li> Enter a name for the new procedure that will be created.
<li> Click Preview to see what changes will be made, then click OK to apply them.
</ol>
<li><b>Example:</b><br>
<center>
<img src="../images/Photran-extract-proc-1.png" alt="Simple example of the Extract Procedure refactoring"></img></center>
</ul>
</p><h1>Extract Local Variable
</h1><p><ul>
<li><b>Description:</b> Extract Local Variable removes a subexpression from a larger expression
and assigns that subexpression to a local variable, replacing the original subexpression
with a reference to that variable.  This refactoring is usually used to eliminate duplicated
subexpressions or to introduce explanatory variable names into complex expressions.
<li><b>Caveats:</b> The refactoring will only be allowed to proceed if extracting the
subexpression will preserve the associativity and precedence of the original expression.
This refactoring assumes that the extracted expression has no side effects; it does
<b>not
</b> check whether moving the computation of the extracted expression will change the
behavior of the program.
<li><b>Operation:</b>
<ol>
<li> Select an expression in the editor.
<li> Click Refactor &gt; Extract Local Variable...
The Extract Local Variable dialog will appear.
<li> Enter the type and name for the new local variable that will be created.
<li> Click Preview to see what changes will be made, then click OK to apply them.
</ol>
</ul>
</p><h1>Canonicalize Keyword Capitalization
</h1><p><ul>
<li><b>Description:</b> Makes all applicable keywords the same case throughout the selected Fortran
program files.
<li><b>Applies To:</b> All keywords except those listed below.
<li><b>Does not apply to:</b>
<ol>
<li> Identifiers
<li> All constants except for integer constants and real constants
</ol>
<li><b>Operation:</b>
<ol>
<li> This is a multiple-file refactoring.
<ul>
<li> <i>To Canonicalize Keyword Capitalization in a single file,</i>
open the file in the editor and choose Refactor &gt; Canonicalize
Keyword Capitalization from the menu bar.

<li><b>Example</b><br>
<center>
<img src="../images/Photran-canonicalize-keyword-cap-1.PNG" alt="Example of Canonicalize Keyword Capitalization refactoring."></img></center>
</ul>
</p><h1> Make COMMON Variable Names Consistent  
</h1><ul><li><b>Description:
</b> Fortran allows different definitions of a COMMON block to give the same variable different names.  This is confusing.  This refactoring gives the variables the same names in all definitions of the COMMON block.
</li><li><b>Applies To:
</b> All COMMON blocks with a valid name.
</li><li><b>Does not apply to:
</b> COMMON blocks with a NULL name.
</li><li><b>Operation:
