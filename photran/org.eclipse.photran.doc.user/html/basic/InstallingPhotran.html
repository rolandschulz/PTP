<div><h1> System Requirements  
</h1><p>To install Photran 6.0...
You must have 
<b>Eclipse 3.6 (Helios)
</b> installed.
</p><ol><li>You should have the 
<b>C/C++ Development Tools (CDT) 7.0
</b> installed. If you do not...
<ol><li>If you downloaded Eclipse from eclipse.org 
<b>and
</b> you will be following the instructions below for &quot;Installing on a Machine With Internet Access,&quot; then CDT should be installed automatically when you install Photran.
</li><li>Otherwise, CDT probably <i>will not</i> be installed automatically.  You will need to install CDT manually.  Follow the instructions below for &quot;Installing on a Machine Without Internet Access.&quot;  These instructions should also be followed if you did not download Eclipse from eclipse.org (e.g., if you installed it from a Linux distribution like Ubuntu).
</li></ol></li><li>Eclipse must be running on a 
<b>Java 1.5 or later Java Virtual Machine (JVM).
</b> To get reasonable performance, we recommend Sun's JVM 
<a href="http://java.com/en/download/manual.jsp">http://java.com/en/download/manual.jsp</a> or IBM's 
<a href="http://wiki.eclipse.org/index.php/J9">http://wiki.eclipse.org/index.php/J9</a>. OpenJDK (the default JVM on newer versions Fedora Linux) also works well, although GNU Classpath (the default JVM on older versions of Fedora) is generally too slow to be useful.
</li><li>If you want to compile and build Fortran applications, you must have a 
<b>make utility
</b> (such as GNU Make) and a 
<b>Fortran compiler
</b> (such as GNU Fortran) in your system path. Many Linux/Unix systems include these; details on installing them in Windows and Mac are below.

</p><h2>Troubleshooting
</h2><blockquote>The installer in Eclipse 3.6 gives notoriously cryptic error messages, which, unfortunately, are out of Photran's control.  Some of the more common ones are below.  If you run into a different error message and cannot resolve it, please ask for help on the 
<a href="http://www.eclipse.org/photran/mailinglists.php">Photran mailing list
</a>.
</blockquote><p><br>
</p><blockquote><b>Problem:
</b> You receive the following error message during installation.
</blockquote><blockquote><blockquote>Cannot complete the install because one or more required items could not be found.
</blockquote></blockquote><blockquote><blockquote>Missing requirement: 125xxxxxxxxxx 0.0.0.125xxxxxxxxxx requires 'org.eclipse.photran.intel.feature.group 
<a href="5.0.0.xxxx">5.0.0.xxxx</a>' but it could not be found
</blockquote></blockquote><blockquote><b>Solution:
</b> You are attempting to install support for the Intel Fortran compiler, but you are not running Linux.  Go back in the installation wizard, and 
<i>uncheck
</i> &quot;Linux Intel(R) Fortran Compiler Support.&quot;
</blockquote><p><br>
</p><blockquote><b>Problem:
</b> You receive the following error message during installation.
</blockquote><blockquote><blockquote>Cannot complete the install because one or more required items could not be found.
</blockquote></blockquote><blockquote><blockquote>Software being installed: Photran End-User Runtime 5.0.0.xxxx (org.eclipse.photran.feature.group 5.0.0.xxxx)
</blockquote></blockquote><blockquote><blockquote>Missing requirement: Photran End-User Runtime 5.0.0.xxxx (org.eclipse.photran.feature.group 5.0.0.xxxx) requires 'org.eclipse.cdt.feature.group [xxx)' but it could not be found
</blockquote></blockquote><blockquote><b>Solution:
</b> You do not have CDT 6.0 installed, and it couldn't be downloaded and installed automatically.  Try installing CDT 6.0 first, then retry installing Photran.
</blockquote><h1> Additional Instructions for Windows Users  
</h1><p>To compile and run Fortran programs in Photran, you will need to have a Fortran compiler and make utility installed. 
<a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/fortran/">gfortran
</a> and 
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/make">GNU Make
</a> are commonly used (and free). Most Linux/Unix distributions include these. Under Windows, you will need to install Cygwin 
<a href="http://www.cygwin.com/">http://www.cygwin.com/</a> (which optionally includes gfortran and GNU Make) or MinGW 
<a href="http://www.mingw.org/">http://www.mingw.org/</a> and put them on your Windows PATH.
</p><h2>Instructions for Cygwin
</h2><ol><li>Install 
<a href="http://www.cygwin.com/">Cygwin
</a>; the defaults are mostly OK, but you will need to explicitly tell it to include the &quot;Devel&quot; packages (at least gcc4-fortran, gdb, and make) when the installer asks you to select what packages to install. (If gcc4-fortran is not listed under the &quot;Devel&quot; packages, you may have chosen a bad mirror; restart the Cygwin installation, and choose a different mirror instead. Georgia Tech's mirror at gtlib.gatech.edu is generally quite fast and reliable, for example.)
</li><li>Add the Cygwin directories to your Windows PATH. Under Windows XP, the process is as follows:
<ol><li>Make sure you are logged in under an administrator account.
</li><li>Open the Control Panel.
</li><li>Double-click the System icon.
</li><li>Switch to the Advanced tab.
</li><li>Click the Environment Variables button.
</li><li>Under System Variables, find the variable &quot;Path&quot; in the list, and click on it.
</li><li>Click Edit.
</li><li>At the end of the &quot;Variable Value&quot; text, add <pre>;C:\Cygwin\bin;C:\Cygwin\usr\bin;C:\Cygwin\usr\local\bin;C:\Cygwin\lib;C:\Cygwin\usr\lib</pre>
</li><li>Click OK, click OK, click OK, and close the Control Panel.
</li><li>Close and re-open Photran. Windows should now search C:\Cygwin\bin, C:\Cygwin\usr\bin, etc. when it's looking for executables (including make.exe, gcc.exe, and gfortran.exe).
</li></ol></li></ol><h1> Additional Instructions for Mac OS X Users  
</h1><p>If you install gfortran on Mac OS X, it may be installed in /usr/local/bin, which is not (by default) on the PATH. If you are launching Eclipse from a Terminal, the PATH can be set by modifying /etc/paths. However, if you are launching Eclipse from the Finder (by double clicking on it) or the Dock, then the PATH is not obtained from the shell or /etc/paths. Instead, it's obtained from ~/.MacOSX/environment.plist. The format of the environment.plist file is as follows (change the path appropriately). 
<i>If you create or edit this file, you will need to log out (or reboot) before the changes will take effect.
</i><pre>&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?&gt;
&lt;!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC &quot;-//Apple Computer//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN&quot; &quot;http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd&quot;&gt;
&lt;plist version=&quot;1.0&quot;&gt;
&lt;dict&gt;
&lt;key&gt;PATH&lt;/key&gt;
&lt;string&gt;/usr/local/mpi/bin:/usr/local/bin:/bin:/sbin:/usr/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/sbin:/Developer/Tools:/usr/texbin:/Users/greg/bin&lt;/string&gt;
&lt;/dict&gt;
&lt;/plist&gt;
