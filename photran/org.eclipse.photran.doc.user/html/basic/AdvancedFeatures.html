<div><p>Photran 6.0 includes a number of sophisticated features that are designed to make it easier to write, modify, search, and maintain Fortran code. These include content assist, which can &quot;auto-complete&quot; variable and function names as you type; a declaration view, which can show the leading comments for the selected variable or procedure; Fortran Search, which allows you to find declarations and references to modules, variables, procedures, etc.; and refactorings, which change your source code to improve its design while preserving its behavior.

Documentation for Photran's advanced features is available
