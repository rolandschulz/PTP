<div><p>There are three major changes in Photran 6 that affect users of previous versions of Photran:
</p><ol><li><b>Projects must be converted to Fortran projects.
</b>&nbsp; In the past, Photran would treat C projects and Fortran projects similarly.&nbsp; In fact, in Photran 4 and earlier versions, Photran's new project wizard actually created C projects!&nbsp; But in Photran 6, many of Photran's features will only be available after a project is converted to a Fortran project.&nbsp; (Every Fortran project is a C project too, so CDT's features will still work on the project.)&nbsp;

</li><li><b>Project properties must be reset.
</b>&nbsp; Photran 6 uses a new mechanism for storing project properties.&nbsp; Unfortunately, this means that the project properties for old projects must be re-created.&nbsp; This includes enabling analysis/refactoring and setting include paths and module paths.<br>
</li><li><b>Source form settings must be set for the project.
</b>&nbsp; Previous versions of Photran used Eclipse's workspace-wide settings to distinguish free and fixed form files.&nbsp; In Photran 6, each project has its own settings that determine which filename extensions correspond to free and fixed source form (and which files contain C preprocessor directives).&nbsp;
