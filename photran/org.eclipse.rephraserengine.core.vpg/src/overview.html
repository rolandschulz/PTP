<h1>Virtual Program Graph - Architectural Overview</h1>

<!-- ============================================================================================================== -->
<!-- ============================================================================================================== -->
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<!-- ============================================================================================================== -->
<!-- ============================================================================================================== -->

<p>In source-to-source program transformation systems,
it is common to represent programs as abstract syntax trees (ASTs) with &quot;extra&quot; edges between nodes.
For example, an AST node representing the use of a variable <i>i</i> might have an edge pointing to the
declaration of <i>i.</i>  A subclass might have a different kind of edge pointing at its superclass.
Edges can also be used to describe dependencies, data flow, control flow, and many other properties.
An AST with these &quot;extra&quot; edges is called a <i>program graph.</i></p>

<div class="indent1">
<!-- ============================================================================================================== -->
<h3>Example</h3>
<!-- ============================================================================================================== -->


<p>Consider the following program in a fictitious programming language.</p>

<pre>
program
  integer i = 3
  print i + " is the value of i" 
end program
</pre>

<p>A program graph might look like the following.  The nodes and solid edges comprise the AST;
rectangular nodes represent tokens in the source program.
The &quot;extra&quot; edges--the edges that make it a program graph rather than just an ordinary
AST--are labeled and dotted.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="doc-files/vpg.png" border="0"></p>

<p>This program graph has two types of edges.
<ul>
<li> A <i>binding</i> edge links variables references to their corresponding declarations.
<li> A <i>scope of declaration</i> edge links declarations to the node representing their scope.
</ul>
</p>

<p>Now, consider how this graph can be used.
<ul>
<li> To find the declaration of a variable, we simply follow the <i>binding</i> edge to its declaration.
<li> To find all of the references to a variable, we search for all of the <i>binding</i> edges pointing
     to its declaration.
<li> To determine the scope of a variable, we follow its <i>scope of declaration</i> edge.
<li> Similarly, we can find all of the variables defined in a scope by searching for all of the
     <i>scope of declaration</i> edges pointing to that node.
<li> A <i>scope of declaration</i> edge links declarations to the node representing their scope.
</ul>
</p>

<h2>Virtual Program Graphs (VPGs)</h2>
<!-- ============================================================================================================== -->
<!-- ============================================================================================================== -->

<p>Often, program graphs only conceptual: &quot;Real&quot; programs can be extremely large,
spanning hundreds of files, and edges may span across these files.  For example, a function
defined in one file may be used in another, so a <i>binding</i> edge would span across files.
Of course, it is inefficient--and sometimes impossible--to store ASTs for several hundred files
in memory.  Therefore, most systems cache information about externally-visible
declarations in a <b>program database.</b>
It becomes the programmer's responsibility to parse individual files and to distinguish what
is available the program database from what is available in the AST.</p>

<p>The <tt>bz.over.vpg</tt> package serves as a basis for implementing <b>virtual program graphs,</b> which
hide parsing and database access from the programmer.  Essentially, the programmer can <i>pretend</i>
that an AST for the entire (several-hundred-file) program is available in memory.</p>

<!--p><i>N.B. There is a separate package <tt>(bz.over.vpg.core.eclipse)</tt> which allows a VPG to be
integrated into an Eclipse plug-in, automatically updating itself when files are changed.
The additional features and requirements of Eclipse-integrated VPGs are described
<a href="#Eclipse">later</a>..</i></p-->

<h3>Using a Virtual Program Graph</h3>
<!-- ============================================================================================================== -->

<p>In this section, we will describe how a virtual program appears to work according to someone who is using
it to write a refactoring or implement a search feature in an IDE, etc.  In other words, this is its
external interface, the interface seen by people who need to do program analyses.</p>

<p>To a user, the VPG itself appears to have only two capabilities:
<ul>
<li> When the user needs the AST for a particular file, he asks the VPG to provide it to him.
<li> The VPG contains an error log, describing files that could not be parsed for one reason or another.
     At times, the user may want to retrieve entries from this log and display them to the user.
</ul>
</p>

<p>When used properly, the real benefit of a VPG is the methods that can be added to AST nodes.
   In the example VPG in the picture above, for example, 
<ul>
<li> The user could call a method <tt>getDeclaration()</tt> on a <tt>VariableReference</tt> node,
     which would return the corresponding <tt>Declaration</tt> node.
<li> The user could call a method <tt>getAllReferences()</tt> on a <tt>Declaration</tt> node,
     which would return a list of all of the references to that declaration.
<li> The user could call a method <tt>getScope()</tt> on a <tt>Declaration</tt> node,
     which would return the scope of that definition (e.g., a <tt>Program</tt> node).
<li> The user could call a method <tt>getScope()</tt> on a <tt>VariableReference</tt> node,
     which would return the scope of its definition.
</ul>
</p>

<p>Again, it is important to remember that the returned node <i>does not have to be in the same file.</i>
For example, <tt>getAllReferences()</tt> could return a list of all of the references to that variable,
even if they span hundreds of files.  (Of course, it does not have to load hundreds of ASTs into memory
to do this!)</p>

<h3>Building a Virtual Program Graph</h3>
<!-- ============================================================================================================== -->

<p>This section describes how methods on AST nodes (such as the ones in the bulleted list above)
are actually implemented.  (If you are simply <i>using</i> a VPG, there is no reason to read this
section: If a VPG is implemented well, all of this should be hidden from you.)</p>

<div class="indent2">

<h4>Dependencies, Edges, Annotations, and the VPG Database</h4>
<!-- ============================================================================================================== -->

<p>VPGs contain a number of methods that are not visible to ordinary users
of VPGs: They are intended to be used only for implementing user-visible methods on AST nodes,
such as the ones described above.</p>  

<p>Recall that a program graph is just an AST with extra edges.
A VPG contains edges, but it also contains <i>dependencies</i> and <i>annotations.</i>
<ul>
<li> <i>Edges</i> were described above: They point from one AST node to another.  There can be
     many different types of edges.
<li> <i>Dependencies</i> point from one file to another.  For example, if File A uses a function
     defined in File B, then there is a dependency from File A to File B.  A dependency could also
     occur if File A imports a module from File B, or <tt>#include</tt>s File B (in C/C++), etc.
<li> <i>Annotations</i> let an arbitrary object be associated with a node in an AST.
     For example, some object describing the type of a variable
     (e.g., &quot;integer array of length 10&quot;)
     could be associated with a <tt>Declaration</tt> node in an AST.
</ul>
</p>

<p>All of the edges, dependencies, and annotations are stored on disk in a <i>VPG Database.</i></p>

</div>

<div class="indent2">
<a name="TokenRef"></a>
<h4>TokenRefs</h4>
<!-- ============================================================================================================== -->

<p>A <tt>TokenRef</tt> is just a simple object with three fields:
<ul>
<li> a filename,
<li> an offset, and
<li> a length.
</ul>
</p>

<p>Since edges point from one AST node to another, annotations are associated with a particular
AST node, and both edges and annotations are stored on disk, there needs to be some concise way to describe
AST nodes.  This is the purpose of a <tt>TokenRef</tt>.<p>

<p>As the name implies, <tt>TokenRef</tt>s are actually suitable for uniquely identifying particular
<i>tokens</i> in an AST.  <i>Although it should be hidden from the </i>user<i> of
a VPG, the edges and annotations in a VPG are actually associated with tokens, not arbitrary AST nodes.</i>
This was a carefully-made decision, based on the heuristic that essentially every &quot;interesting&quot;
node in a AST has at least one token that can be used to distinguish it from other &quot;interesting&quot;
nodes.  Functions have names.  Variables have names.  Programs have names.  Scopes are typically
things like functions or programs.  Assignment statements have an equals sign.  And so forth.</p>

<p><small><i>Again, this is a heuristic.  One common case where it is not true is when the root
node of an AST needs to be annotated: This can be handled, for example, by deciding that a
<tt>TokenRef</tt> referring to offset -1, length 0 refers to the root node of the AST, by convention.
If it really is necessary to refer to completely arbitrary nodes in the AST, one could cheat: The
nodes in an AST could be numbered from 0 to </i>n<i>, and the &quot;offset&quot; of a <tt>TokenRef</tt>
could store a node number (the length field could be ignored).</i></small></p>

</div>

<div class="indent2">
<h4>Mapping TokenRefs to Tokens</h4>
<!-- ============================================================================================================== -->

<p>VPGs provide a method <tt>findToken(TokenRef)</tt> which returns a pointer to the given token in an AST.
This is called <i>dereferencing the <tt>TokenRef</tt>.</i></p>

<p>This is perhaps surprising, because an AST for the file pointed to might or might not be in memory.
   This is fine; since the VPG is where users go to request ASTs anyway, the VPG &quot;knows&quot; whether
   an AST for that file is in memory or not.  If not, it loads it.
   When a VPG needs to provide an AST for a file, regardless of whether the user requests it or it
   happens as a result of dereferencing a <tt>TokenRef</tt>, the following happens.
<ul>
<li> The VPG maintains a cache of ASTs.  If an up-to-date AST is available in the cache, it is
     simply provided to the user.  If not, the VPG calls the parser, which provides an AST.
<li> The VPG database is checked; if the information for the file it parsed is out of date,
     the dependencies, edges, and annotations for that file (and any dependent files) are recalculated.
<li> The new AST is added to the cache.
</ul>

<p>When an AST is requested from the VPG, the requested AST can be either <i>permanent</i> or <i>transient</i>.
A transient AST will be garbage collected when there are no pointers remaining to any of its nodes.
A permanent AST will be held in memory until the user explicitly tells the VPG to release it.
If dereferencing a <tt>TokenRef</tt> requires building a new AST, a transient AST is constructed, so it
can be garbage collected as soon as the user is done using that AST.  Of course, the user can ask the
VPG to make that AST permanent if he so desires.</p>

</div>

<div class="indent2">
<h4>VPG-Building Methods</h4>
<!-- ============================================================================================================== -->

<p>VPGs provide package-private methods to
<ul>
<li> add dependencies, edges, and annotations,
<li> delete dependencies, edges, and annotations,
<li> retrieve all of the incoming or outgoing edges to/from a particular token,
<li> retrieve all of the incoming or outgoing dependencies to/from a particular file,
<li> log errors and warnings, and 
<li> delete all of the dependencies, edges, and annotations associated with a particular file.
</ul>
</p>

<p>In the section &quot;Using a Virtual Program Graph,&quot; we described several methods that
could be implemented on AST nodes using a VPG.  For example, we suggested that
&quot;The user could call a method <tt>getAllReferences()</tt> on a <tt>Declaration</tt> node,
which would return a list of all of the references to that declaration.&quot;
This could be implemented as follows.
<ul>
<li> When the VPG is built, <i>binding</i> edges are pointed at the identifier token
     associated with the declaration.
<li> To get all of the references, we ask the VPG for all of the incoming <i>binding</i>
     edges for the identifier.  Each of these points to another token.  If necessary, we
     can search upwards from each token in the AST, and return its <tt>VariableDeclaration</tt>
     node.
</ul>

<a name="Eclipse"></a>
<h2>Eclipse Integration</h2>
<!-- ============================================================================================================== -->
<!-- ============================================================================================================== -->

Special support is provided for integrating VPGs into Eclipse-based tools.
<ul>
<li> Eclipse-based VPGs can sit quietly in the background, updating the VPG database
     incrementally as the user edits files.  When the Eclipse-based VPG is
     &quot;started,&quot; it scans the entire Eclipse workspace to make sure its database
     entries for all of the files are up-to-date.  Then, it updates itself incrementally
     as files are added, changed, or deleted.
<li> There is a special type of workspace job and scheduling rule for tasks which access
     the VPG.  These ensure that only one VPG job is running at any given time.
     The background/incremental updates are one type of VPG job, and it is important
     not to read from or write to the VPG while those are running.  Additionally,
     the provided implementations of VPGs are not thread-safe: If two threads try to access
     the VPG simultaneously, very strange errors can occur, such as parser stack underflows
     or a completely corrupted VPG database.
</ul> 

<!--h2>Implementing a Virtual Program Graph</h2>
    
<p>VPGs were designed according to the following principles.
<ul>
<li> Parsing a file and constructing an AST is inexpensive and can be done &quot;on demand.&quot;
<li> Disk accesses are expensive; a minimal amount of information should be maintained on disk.
</ul>
</p>

There are several example VPGs available, which should be used as reference for implementing
a VPG. -->
