This section addresses the most common issues encountered when using GEM. If you encounter something
that is not not mentioned here, please email your problem to <A href="mailto:isp-dev@cs.utah.edu">isp-dev@cs.utah.edu</a>. We
will get back to you with a solution as soon as possible.

        When I run Gem on a particular source file I get a dialog box appears stating that a valid
        executable could not be created from the source file:<br/><br/><img src="images/invalidExecutable.png">
    </td>
    <td>
        SOLUTION-1
	    You have most likely run the GEM command <b>&#34;Formally Verify MPI Program&#34;</b> on
	    a source file that does not contain a <b>main()</b> program entry point, or does not simply compile by itself.
	    Remember, for anything larger than a simple single-file Managed Build Project you will need to create a Makefile
	    Project and run GEM via the steps outlined in <a href="makefileSupport.html">GEM Makefile Support</a>.
        <br/><br/>
        SOLUTION-2
        If you get STDERR in the GEM Console like the following:
        <pre>
            /usr/local/lib/libisp_prof.so: undefined reference to `MPI::Win::Free()'
            /usr/local/lib/libisp_prof.so: undefined reference to `MPI::Datatype::Free()'
            /usr/local/lib/libisp_prof.so: undefined reference to `MPI::Comm::Comm()'
            /usr/local/lib/libisp_prof.so: undefined reference to `ompi_mpi_cxx_op_intercept'
        </pre>
        Then you are most likely using OpenMPI and <tt><b>libmpi_cxx</b></tt> is not being linked in by 
        <tt><b>ispcc</b></tt>. Locate the script <tt><b>ispcc</b></tt> and add <tt><b>-lmpi_cxx</b></tt>
        to the end of the single line in the script beginning with <tt><b>exec</b></tt> (see example below).
        <pre>
        exec "/usr/local/bin/mpicc" "-L/usr/local/lib" "-I/usr/local/include/isp" \
        -Wl,-rpath=/usr/local/lib -include isp.h $* -lisp_prof -lmpi_cxx
        </pre>

        You can terminate the current GEM operation by clicking the <img src="images/terminate.gif"> &#34;Terminate
        Operation&#34; button in the GEM <a href="consoleView.html">Console View</a>.<br/><br/>
        You also may have most run the GEM command <b>&#34;Formally Verify MPI Program&#34;</b> on
        a source file that does not contain a <b>main()</b> program entry point, or does not simply compile by itself.
        Remember, for anything larger than a simple single-file Managed Build Project you will need to create a Makefile

    <td>
	    This particular command either does not exist on the target machine or is not in your path. For anything 
	    ISP related, e.g. <b>isp, ispcc, ispCC or ispcxx</b>, you may not have ISP installed. Please install ISP
	    per documentation in the <a href="prereqs.html"> GEM Prerequisites Page</a> and also make sure the 
	    ISP paths are correctly set on the <a href="preferences.html#ispPrefs">ISP Preference Page</a>
