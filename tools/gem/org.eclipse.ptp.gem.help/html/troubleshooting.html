<th>Problem</th><th>Solution</th>

<tr>
    <td>When I try to run GEM, the GEM Console View reports:<br></br> <b>&quot;No such file or directory&quot;</b>.</td>
    <td>Make sure the paths to the ISP executable and other scripts are properly set on the GEM preference page</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>When I try to formally verify my MPI C/C++ application, I get an error message saying that an error occurred while trying to run ISP.</td>
    <td>If the error details say: “Cannot run program ISPCC” Then ISP was not installed properly.  Try re-installing ISP itself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>Dialog box appears stating:<br></br> <b>&quot;An error has occurred while trying to run ISP. Please make sure ISP is configured and installed correctly,
    and that all preferences and paths for the ISP Plugin have been properly set.&quot;</b></td>
    <td>You most likely have not set the paths to the ISP executable or one of its scripts properly in the 
    preference page. Make sure you don't have a trailing <b>&#34;&#47;&#34;</b> on any path. (e.g. &#47;usr&#47;local&#47;bin&#47;)
    Just use the browse buttons on the GEM preference page to safely navigate to the directory.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>I don’t see the GEM icon, there is no trident icon anywhere, and the GEM Views do not exist.</td>
    <td>The Eclipse Plug-­in was not installed properly.  Try installing it again from <a href="http://eclipse.org/ptp/">
        http://eclipse.org/ptp</a>.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>I’m running Eclipse and when I try to running GEM, Eclipse becomes unresponsive.</td>
    <td>Make sure your process manager is running. The GEM Plug-in assumes your process manager is already running</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>I’m trying to view a log file in the Eclipse editor, and I get editor message saying that the file is out of sync with the file system.</td>
    <td>ISP has generates a new log file. Just hit F5 to refresh the Eclipse editor's view of the file.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>I can't find the log file GEM generated in my CDT project.</td>
    <td>Refresh your project. It should be in a directory named &quot;isp&quot; at the same level as the source file.</td>
