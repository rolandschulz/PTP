<h2>Running the Happens Before Viewer</h2>
<p>
The Happens Before Viewer may be launched from within the <a href="analyzerView.html#hbviewer">Analyzer View</a> or
on a log file directly; via context menus as shown in the image below:
</p>

<p>
<i> Note: The generated log file will be in a directory named <b>"gem"</b> at the same level as the source code file
in the project explorer.</i>
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        From the Analyzer View, simply click the <b>HB Viewer</b> button after the analyzer has been run.
    </li>
    <li>
        From the Project Explorer window, right click on source code or ISP generated log file
        and select <img height="16" src="images/hpv-trident.gif" width="13" />
        <b>Launch Happens Before Viewer</b> from the GEM context menu.
    </li>
    
</ul>

<h2>Understanding What You See</h2><br>
<ul>
    <li>
        <b>Showing Interleaving:</b> indicates which interleaving is being shown and how many there are in total.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Deadlock:</b>Is either followed by <font COLOR="#00ff00">no </font>or <font COLOR="#ff0000">yes</font>,
        and indicates if any of the interleavings has a deadlock.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Red Bordered DEADLOCK</b> at the bottom of the window indicates that at this point the currently selected
        interleaving is deadlocked. Calls above this will be issued and calls that would come afterward are not shown.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Process[Number]:</b> This specifies which Process the calls below it belong to (Where Number is the number
        of the process in question). The color of the border around this text is arbitrary and serves only to help
        the human eye distinguish the various columns and return to a column of interest more quickly.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Blue Arrows:</b> show CB (Completes Before) edges that stay in the same process. A CB edge is a guarantee
        that the source must complete before the destination. For example a Barrier will always have a CB edge
        connecting it to the next call in the same process because the next call cannot complete before the barrier
        is finished. It is important to note though that there is only a CB edge to each call blocked by the call in
        question. As an example lets imagine that a Barrier is followed by a second Barrier and then a Send. There
        is a CB edge between the first and second Barrier and between the second Barrier and the Send, but none
        between the first Barrier and the Send because it the second Barriers that directly blocks the send. The
        CB edges are by default not shown, but 4.3 will show you how to make them appear.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Red Arrows</b> show CB edges that connect calls of different processes.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Black Arrows</b> connect calls that match. For example a Send will have a Black Arrow pointing to the
        Receive that picks up its message.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Dotted Black Arrows</b> like solid Block Arrows these connect calls that match. The only difference
        is that these connect a Red Bordered call.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Red Borders</b> indicates that this call is the source of a different interleaving. Or in other words
        that what is currently being displayed is one potential match for the Red Bordered call, but that another
        possible match exists and can be viewed by changing which interleaving is being shown.
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>Changing What You See</h2>
<p>
To change which log file you are viewing you can click File -&gt; Open Trace and navigate to the desired file.
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        To change which Interleaving you are viewing you can click on the &lt; or &gt; buttons or click “Goto”
        after providing the desired interleaving number in the text box next to it.
    </li>
    <li>
        To toggle whether or not you want matches to shown use the check box next to “Show Matches”.
    </li>
    <li>
        To reset the view back to how it was before you made changes click the “Clear” button.
    </li>
    <li>
        To see the source file that generated the log click on “Show Source”.
    </li>
    <li>
        To see only the Intra-process Completes-Before Edges (CBs for a given Processes right click that process and
        select “ViewIntraCB”.<br><br>
        <img src="images/process-intracb.png"><br><br>
    </li>
    <li>
        To add Completes-Before Edges (CBs) for a given call to the current window, right click the call and select either View
        IntraCB, View InterCB, or View Both as desired. Lastly you will need to indicate whether you want to view
        the results in the current window or in a new popup window.
    </li>
</ul>
