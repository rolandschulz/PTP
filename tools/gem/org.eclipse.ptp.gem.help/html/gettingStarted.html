<h3>This page serves to get the new GEM user up and running.</h3>

<p>
To help get the new GEM user started, this page will walk through examples of how to use GEM 
to formally verify a MPI Managed-Build project as well as a larger MPI Makefile project. Please
note that when we say <b>&#34;formally verify&#34;</b>, we mean <b>&#34;check for correctness&#34;</b>
of your MPI application.
</p>

For Example - GEM will check your MPI application for the presence of:
<ul>
    <li>Deadlocks</li>
    <li>Functionally Irrelevant Barriers</li>
    <li>MPI Object Leaks</li>
    <li>Local Assertion Violations</li>
    <li>MPI Type Mismatches</li>
</ul>

<p>
These errors and problems are <b>extremely difficult</b> to detect and find with traditional 
debugging tools and practices.
</p>

<p>
Remember that no code instrumentation is necessary. At compile time, GEM will link in its profiler library
which takes care of everything for you automatically (using the PMPI mechanism). GEM offers push-button formal
verification for MPI C/C++ applications.
</p>

<p>
The main idea here is to illustrate just how easy it is to do verification on your MPI application <b>throughout</b>
your project&#39;s life-cycle. A developer can create, edit, compile, verify, parallel debug (for standard logic errors) 
and launch your MPI apps all from the comfort of the Eclipse IDE. 
</p>

<h2>Verifying a MPI <ins>Managed Build</ins> Project</h2>

<h3>STEP - 1:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Set the Number of Processes to Verify With</h3>
This would be the same number of processes that you would run your MPI application with mpiexec or mpirun:<br/>
To do this, please consult the help page detailing <a href="setNumProcs.html">Setting the number of processes</a>

<h3>STEP - 2:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Specify Command Line Arguments</h3>

Depending on whether or not the preference is set to collect command line arguments to pass to 
your MPI application, a dialog may be opened prior to verification to collect this information.

<br/><br/>

<h3>STEP - 3:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Choose the project to verify with GEM</h3>
In this example, we&#39;ll verify the simple <b>MPI Pi C</b> project that you can create with the CDT New
MPI Project Wizard.<br/>
<i>NOTE: GEM&#39;s views may not be visible at first, but will be opened when a verification run is started.</i><br/><br/>

Your C/C++ perspective might look something like the image below (notice the <tt><b>Pi.c</b></tt> file open in the Eclipse editor).<br/><br/>
<img src="images/gemPiExample.png">

<p>
When you formally verify an MPI C/C++ program, the Console, Browser and Analyzer Views will both be
opened and depending on what is specified in preferences, one of these views will be brought to the foreground
and given the active focus.
</p>

<p>
There are three initial ways to start GEM&#39;s verification process on your MPI application:
</p>

<ol>
    <li>
        Open the source code file in the Eclipse editor window and select
        <img height="16" src="images/trident.gif" width="13" /><b>Formally Verify MPI Program</b>
        from the trident pull-down icon on the Eclipse toolbar.
		<br/><br/> 
		<img src="images/runVerify.png">
		<br/><br/> 
    </li>
    <li>
        From the Project Explorer window, right click on the <tt><b>Pi.c</b></tt> source code file and select
        <img height="16" src="images/trident.gif" width="13" /><b>Formally Verify MPI Program</b>
        from the GEM context menu (see image below).
    </li>
    <li>
        Open the source code file in the Eclipse editor window, right click on the source file <tt><b>Pi.c</b></tt>
        source code file in the editor window and select
        <img height="16" src="images/trident.gif" width="13" /><b>Formally Verify MPI Program</b>
        from the GEM context menu (see image below).
        <br/><br/>
        <img src="images/sourceCodePopUp.png">
        <br/><br/>
    </li>
</ol>


<h3>STEP - 4:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Use GEM Views to Locate and Correct MPI Errors &#47; Problems</h3>

<p>

</p>

<p>
Once verification starts you will see the three GEM Views open (the they aren&#39;t already). Terminal output will 
be presented as it occurs in the Console View, <b>STDOUT</b> in black and <b>STDERR</b> in red. This output serves
to inform the user of forward progress, a status bar of sorts, as there is now way to determine exactly how long a 
verification run will take (hence no Progress Monitor).
</p>

<img src="images/gemConsole.png">
<br/><br/>

<ol>
	<li>
		The <b>Analyzer View</b> will help you walk through the execution of your MPI application
		and understand the MPI runtime as GEM is a dynamic formal verification tool and tracks the actual events 
		as they occurred at runtime.
		<br/><br/>
		For detailed coverage of the <b>Analyzer View</b> and how to use it, please refer to the
		 <a href="analyzerView.html"><b>Analyzer View Documentation</b></a>.
		 <br/><br/>
		<img src="images/analyzer.png">
		<br/><br/>
	</li>
	<li>
		The <b>Browser View</b> summarizes and categorically groups all of the errors and warnings found 
		by GEM on a particular MPI verification run. The summary label (just above the tabs) gives the 
		user a quick overview of problems found. Errors and warnings are mapped to the corresponding 
		source code lines in the Eclipse editor. The Browser View's tabs help the user to quickly locate 
		and fix MPI errors flagged by GEM in their source code.
		<br/><br/>
		For detailed coverage of the <b>Browser View</b> and how to use it, please refer to the
		 <a href="browserView.html"><b>Browser View Documentation</b></a>.	
		<br/><br/>	
		<img src="images/browser.png">
		<br/><br/>
	</li>
	<li>
		The <b>Console View</b> is described and shown at the beginning of step 3 (above).
		<br/>
		For detailed coverage of the <b>Console View</b> and how to use it, please refer to the
		 <a href="consoleView.html"><b>Console View Documentation</b></a>.

	</li>
</ol>

<h2>Verifying a MPI <ins>Makefile Build</ins> Project</h2>

The process for verifying a <b>Makefile</b> Project differs only slightly an is detailed in
the <a href="makefileSupport.html"><b>Makefile Support Documentation</b></a>.
