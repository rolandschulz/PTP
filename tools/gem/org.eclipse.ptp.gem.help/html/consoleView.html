<h2>Activating the Console View</h2>

<p>
The Console View is opened automatically when GEM is run. This allows the user to see progress as GEM runs and
also gives the user a chance to cancel long running operations. Once a GEM verification run is complete, the
view with the active focus will visible &#40;see the GEM <a href=preferences.html#gemPrefs>Preference Page</a>
for details&#41;.
</p>

<h2>Console Overview</h2>
The GEM Console view is dedicated console for viewing STDOUT &#38; STDERR from ISP itself. No other terminal data will 
be present here. The STDOUT generated in the Console View will be useful to the advanced user, but in general, the
Browser &#38; and Analyzer views exist to graphically examine this output as well as the generated trace file. 
STDERR will be printed to the GEM Console in bold red.

<p>
The Console View serves as an informal progress monitor while GEM is running &nbsp;&#8212;&nbsp;a status bar of sorts.
The actual time to formally verify any MPI application is essentially unknown and hence no actual Progress Monitor object.
It may be useful to see <b>STDOUT</b> &#38; <b>STDERR</b> in general (if it exists), to know when a verification run is 
complete, as other GEM views will get active focus once verification is complete. The Console View also gives
the user the opportunity to cancel stalled or long-running operations with the Eclipse standard cancel button

<h3>Understanding Output</h3>
Please reference the <a href="output.html">Understanding GEM Output help page</a>.

<p>
The image below shows what the Console View should look like.

<p>
<b>Note:</b>&nbsp; On the <a href=preferences.html#gemPrefs>GEM Preference Page</a>, you can specify whether you want new output to 
replace the older or if it should be appended to the existing terminal output.
</p>

<h3>GEM Console View Options</h3>
This view's toolbar has three buttons:<br><br>
<img height="16" src="images/clear-console.gif" width="16">
Clear Console - Removes all entries from the consoles, leaving it blank.<br>
<img height="16" src="images/save-file.gif" width="16">
Save Output to File - Launches a window that lets you save the current contents as a .txt file anywhere you want.<br>
<img height="16" src="images/help-contents.gif" width="16">
Get GEM Console Help - Opens the Eclipse help topic related to the GEM Console View.

<p>
<b>Note:</b> This same functionality can be obtained through the context and pull-down menus for the view.
