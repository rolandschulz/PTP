<h2>Activating the Browser View</h2>
<p>
When you formally verify an MPI C/C++ program, the Browser View and the Analyzer View will both be
opened and depending on what is specified in preferences either one may be brought to the foreground
and given the active focus.
</p>

<h2>Browser Overview</h2>
<p>
In the menu of this view there are three buttons
</p>
	<ul>
		<li>The <img src="images/terminate.gif"> Terminates the current operation</li>
		<li>The <img src="images/save-file.gif"> Saves the results to a file</li>
		<li>The <img src="images/help-contents.gif"> Opens this help page</li>
	</ul>

<p>
The purpose of this view is to summarize and categorically group all of the errors and warnings found.
At the top left is a brief summary of the results indicating the number of errors and warnings found.
In the top right are users are provided with the ability to set the number of processes and run ISP.
</p>

<p>
Below the summary is a section containing a tab for category of error or warning that was found in the
code. By opening a given tab you are given detailed information on each occurrence of that type of
error or warning in your code. Clicking on any of these occurrences will open the Eclipse editor with that line
of code highlighted.  If there are no instances of the problem then there is a short message indicating as much.
Furthermore, a user is shown which types of errors are presented via the icons of the tab.
</p>
	<ul>
		<li>The <img src="images/no-error.gif"> indicates that there are no instances of that type of problem</li>
		<li>The <img src="images/magnified-trident.gif"> tells the user that this problem is present in their code.</li>
	</ul>


<h2>Errors Tab</h2>
This tab is reserved for problems that cause the program to crash or deadlock.

<h2>Assertion Violations Tab</h2>
This tab list all local assertion violations found.

<h2>Leak Tab</h2>
This tab list all MPI resource leaks found.

<h2>Irrelevant Barriers Tab</h2>
This tab is reserved for Irrelevant Barriers or barriers that can be safely removed without changing the runtime
behavior of the program (aside from possibly speeding the program up a little).
