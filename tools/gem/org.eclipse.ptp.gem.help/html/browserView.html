<h2>Activating the Browser View</h2>
<p>
Before formally verifying an MPI C/C++ program, you need to set the number of processes
for a particular run. Please refer to the <a href="setNumProcs.html">Setting the Number of Processes Page</a>.
</p>

<p>
When you formally verify an MPI C/C++ program, the Browser View and the Analyzer View will both be
opened and depending on what is specified in preferences, either one may be brought to the foreground
and given the active focus.
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        Open the source code file in the Eclipse editor window and select
        <img height="16" src="images/trident.gif" width="13" /><b>Formally Verify MPI Program</b>
        from the trident pull-down icon on the Eclipse toolbar.
    </li>
    <li>
        From the Project Explorer window, right click on the C source code file and select
        <img height="16" src="images/trident.gif" width="13" /><b>Formally Verify MPI Program</b>
        from the GEM context menu.
    </li>
    <li>
        Open the source code file in the Eclipse editor window, right click in the editor window and select
        <img height="16" src="images/trident.gif" width="13" /><b>Formally Verify MPI Program</b>
        from the GEM context menu.
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>Browser Overview</h2>
<p>
This highly functional view summarizes and categorically groups all of the errors and warnings found
by GEM on a particular verification run. The summary label (just above the tabs) gives the user a quick
overview of problems found. Errors and warnings are mapped to the corresponding source code lines in 
the Eclipse editor.  The Browser View&#39;s tabs help the user to quickly locate and fix MPI errors 
flagged by GEM in their source code.
</p>

<p>
Below are listings of the errors and warnings summarized by GEM's Browser View, along with a more
detailed descriptions. 
</p>

<p>
<i>The image below shows what the Browser View should look like along with an explanation of its components.</i>
</p>

<h2>Browser View Tabs</h2>

<p>
Below the summary is a section containing a tab for category of error or warning that was found in the
code. By selecting a particular tab the user is given detailed information on each occurrence of that type of
error or warning in their MPI code. Clicking on any of these occurrences takes the user to the offending 
line in the source code within the Eclipse editor.If there are no instances of the problem then there is 
a short message indicating as much. Furthermore, a user is shown which types of errors are presented via 
the icons of the tab (see icons directly below).
</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		<img src="images/no-error.gif">
		Indicates that there are no instances of this particular type of problem.
	</li>
	<li>
		<img src="images/magnified-trident.gif">
		Tells the user that this problem is present in their code.
	</li>
</ul>

<h3>Deadlocks Tab</h3>
This tab allows the user to visit all of the calls that did not complete due to a detected deadlock.

<h3>Assertion Violations Tab</h3>
This tab list all local assertion violations found. CLicking any one of these will take the user to the line of 
source code with the failed assertion.

<h3>Leaks Tab</h3>
Clicking any of these will take the user to the line of source code where the corresponding un-freed MPI 
resource was allocated (these are usually MPI communicators and MPI DataTypes).

<h3>Irrelevant Barriers Tab</h3>
This tab is reserved for Functionally Irrelevant Barriers. Clicking any these will take the user to the corresponding
MPI_Barrier call itself, which can then be safely removed without changing the runtime behavior of the program.
This could potentially serve to speed the application of in the absence of unnecessary synchronization.

<h3>Type Mismatches Tab</h3>
These are warnings about the send type not matching the receive type.

<h2>Button Explanations</h2>
<p>
<img height="20" src="images/setNumProcsCombo.gif" width="47" /> The first drop down combo-box shows the current number of
processes and lets the user conveniently choose a new value for the next GEM run.
</p>

<p>
<img height="16" src="images/trident.gif" width="12" /> This will re-run GEM on the current MPI project. This is semantically
equivalent to choosing &#34;Formally Verify MPI Program&#34; from the toolbar button drop-down and is provided for convenience.
</p>

<h2>Menu &#38; Toolbar Options</h2>
<ul>
	<li>
		<img src="images/terminate.gif">
		Terminate Operation - Forcibly terminates the current GEM operation
	</li>
	<li>
		<img src="images/save-file.gif">
		Save to File - Saves a listing of all results to a local text file.
	</li>
	<li>
		<img src="images/help-contents.gif">
		Get Browser Help - Opens the Eclipse help topic related to the Browser View page.
