<h2>Activating the Browser View</h2>
<p>
Before formally verifying an MPI C/C++ program, you need to set the number of processes
for a particular run. Please refer to the <a href="setNumProcs.html">Setting the Number of Processes Page</a>.
</p>

<p>
When you formally verify an MPI C/C++ program, the Browser View and the Analyzer View will both be
opened and depending on what is specified in preferences, either one may be brought to the foreground
and given the active focus.
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        Open the source code file in the Eclipse editor window and select
        <img height="16" src="images/trident.gif" width="13" /><b>Formally Verify MPI Program</b>
        from the trident pull-down icon on the Eclipse toolbar.
    </li>
    <li>
        From the Project Explorer window, right click on the C source code file and select
        <img height="16" src="images/trident.gif" width="13" /><b>Formally Verify MPI Program</b>
        from the GEM context menu.
    </li>
    <li>
        Open the source code file in the Eclipse editor window, right click in the editor window and select
        <img height="16" src="images/trident.gif" width="13" /><b>Formally Verify MPI Program</b>
        from the GEM context menu.
    </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="errorWarningLabel">Browser Overview</h2>
<p>
This highly functional view is to summarize and categorically groups all of the errors and warnings found
by GEM. Below are listings of the errors and warnings summarized by GEM's Browser View, along with a brief
description. Each error or warning can be clicked and the developer is taken to the corresponding line in 
the source code within the Eclipse editor.
</p>

<p>
The image below shows what the Browser View should look like along with an explanation of its components.
</p>

<img src="images/browserIntegration.png" width="900" height="680"/>

<p>
Below the summary is a section containing a tab for category of error or warning that was found in the
code. By opening a given tab you are given detailed information on each occurrence of that type of
error or warning in your code. Clicking on any of these occurrences will open the Eclipse editor with that line
of code highlighted.  If there are no instances of the problem then there is a short message indicating as much.
Furthermore, a user is shown which types of errors are presented via the icons of the tab.
</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		<img src="images/no-error.gif">
		Indicates that there are no instances of this particular type of problem.
	</li>
	<li>
		<img src="images/magnified-trident.gif">
		Tells the user that this problem is present in their code.
	</li>
</ul>


<h2>Deadlocks Tab</h2>
This tab allows the user to visit all of the calls that did not complete due to a detected deadlock.

<h2>Assertion Violations Tab</h2>
This tab list all local assertion violations found. CLicking any one of these will take the user to the line of 
source code with the failed assertion.

<h2>Leaks Tab</h2>
Clicking any of these will take the user to the line of source code where the corresponding un-freed MPI 
resource was allocated (these are usually MPI communicators and MPI DataTypes).

<h2>Irrelevant Barriers Tab</h2>
This tab is reserved for Functionally Irrelevant Barriers. Clicking any these will take the user to the corresponding
MPI_Barrier call itself, which can then be safely removed without changing the runtime behavior of the program.
This could potentially serve to speed the application of in the absence of unnecessary synchronization.

<h2>Type Mismatches Tab</h2>
These are warnings about the send type not matching the receive type.
