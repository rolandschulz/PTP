<p>
GEM supports CDT C and C++ Makefile projects with a minimum effort required on the part of the programmer.
Just some minor modifications to your project's Makefiles and you'll be able to use GEM with your Makefile 
Projects as well as your Managed Build Projects.
</p>

<h2>Makefile Modification Steps</h2>

<p>
The following are the necessary procedures to modify your CDT Makefile Project so that it can be verified and
analyzed by GEM. If you are creating a project from scratch, make sure to start with a new <b>Makefile Project</b>
and not a <b>Managed-Build Project</b>!
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        <b>
        	Change the compiler to &#34;ispcc&#34; for C or &#34;ispCC&#34; for C++. These are wrappers for 
        	&#34;mpicc&#34; and &#34;mpicxx&#34; that allow ISP's Profiler to intercept MPI calls at runtime.</b>
        <pre>
        # Which compiler to use
        # CC = mpicc  &#60;-- comment this out
        
        # For MPI C applications
        CC = ispcc    &#60;-- add this for C compilation (ispcc is a wrapper for mpicc)
        
        # For MPI C++ applications
        CXX = ispCC   &#60;-- add this for C++ compilation (ispCC is a wrapper for mpicxx)
        </pre>
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>
            GEM requires the fully qualified path to all source code in order to do the code analyzing. ISP itself uses
            the __FILE__ and __LINE__ macros in generating a runtime log. Your Makefiles will have to pass the source files to
            ispcc/ispCC (gcc/g++) at compile time in order to get that back in the same form. This is accomplished by the following being
            added to your Makefiles
        </b>
        <pre>
        SOURCEPATH = $(shell pwd)   # defining this will give the compiler the fully qualified path to each file encountered
        $(CC) $(CFLAGS) -c $(SOURCEPATH)/$*.c   # add this to your build rules
        </pre>
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Change the extension of the generated executables to <i>".gem"</i></b>
        <pre>
        $(BINDIR)/mtest.gem$(VERNUM): $(MESHTESTOBJS) $(ISPOBJS)
        </pre>
    </li>
</ul>    
    
    
<h2>Setting Your Projects up to Build</h2>
<ul>
    <li>
        Create make targets for your Makefile Project
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <img src="images/makeTargets.png">
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        Now simply double click the make target you need.<br>
        <i>You may have to do a little debugging to get everything just right</i>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
    </li>    
</ul>

<h2>Running GEM on the Generated Executables</h2>
<ul>    
    <li>
        Locate the executable(s) with ".gem" extension in the Project Explorer
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <img src="images/gemExtension.png">
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
    </li>
        <li>
        <a href=setNumProcs.html>Set the number of processes</a> for the next run of GEM.
    </li>  
    <li>
        Right click on the previously located executable with <b>&#34;.gem&#34;</b> extension in the Project Explorer
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <img src="images/executablePopUp.png">
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        This should bring up the GEM views &#40;if they aren&#39;t already open&#41; with post verification results.<br/>
