<h2>
Pre-requisites:

<p>This plug-in requires the base Eclipse platform, the CDT, and MPI.
<ul>
<li><b>Eclipse</b> platform: Version  3.1 
<li><b>CDT:</b>
Version 3.0.0, or FDT (for C/C++ files.  Wherever CDT is mentioned, FDT projects and files,
for C/C++, should also work)

<li><b>MPI:</b>
Get MPI and its header file, a version that runs on
your system (e.g. MPICH2 for win32)
<ul>
<li>Make sure it's in your path 
<li>You may need to install it in a directory such that there are no spaces in the path
(that is, not in 'Program Files' etc.)
</ul>
