<h1> Running the PTP MPI Tools Plug-in</h1>



<h3>Now set up to run the PTP MPI plug-ins</h3>
<ol>
<li>Create a project (e.g a Managed Make C project) , and within the project, create a C file that includes MPI code. A sample is <a href="testMPI.c">testMPI.c</a> 

<p>Note: A sample C++ file with MPI calls 
is <a href="helloMPI_cpp_style.cpp">helloMPI_cpp_style.cpp</a>.
<br>A sample C++ file with MPI calls in ordinary C style 
is <a href="helloMPI_c_style.cpp">helloMPI_c_style.cpp</a>.


</ul>
<p>&nbsp;

<li>Open the MPI Artifacts view
- or, the view will be opened automatically when analysis is complete.
<p>Window > Show View > Other... > PTP MPI Views > MPI Artifact View

<p><img src="images/showView.gif">
<p>&nbsp;

<li>Select the source file to analyse, to find the MPI artifacts.
<p>Click the MPI button 
<img src="images/mpi.gif" border=1> in the tool bar.
<p><img src="images/mpiButtons.gif" >
<li>The MPI Artifact View is opened, if it was not present.
It is 
populated with MPI artifacts found.
<p><img src="images/mpiView.gif">
<p>&nbsp;
<li>Double click on any marker in the MPI Artifact View
to navigate the editor to that line in the source file.
<p>&nbsp;
<li>Hover over the MPI Artifact identified in the source file
(by blue squiggles) to see additional information about that
function call, for example. 
<br><img src="images/hover.gif" border=1>
<li>Rows in the MPI Artifact View can be sorted by any of the columns.
Click on the column heading to sort.
<li>Click the "Clear MPI Artifacts Markers" button 
<img src="images/nompi.gif" border=1> in the tool bar to remove all
the markers.
<li>You can run the analysis on another file and its markers
will be added to the view.
<li>You can run the analysis on more than one file (multiple selection)
or a container (folder or project), to analyse more than one file at a time.
Click on a project or a folder, then click the
MPI button 
<img src="images/mpi.gif" border=1> 
 to run it on all C source files in that folder.
<p>
<li><b>Content Assist</b><br>
Type an incomplete MPI function name e.g. "MPI_Ini"
and hit Ctrl-Space. The information that is shown
is populated with CDT completions including argument
types, but in addition, the PTP-MPI tools also provide
specific information about actual MPI constant values, etc.
where appropriate, and a yellow popup with additional 
textual descriptive information about the function.
<br><img src="images/contentAssist.gif" border=1>
<p>
<li><b>Content sensitive help</b><br>
Also, if F1 is pressed when the cursor is within
a function name, a help view appears which shows additional information.

<br><img src="images/helpContSensHitF1.gif" border=1>
<p>Help View appears:
<br><img src="images/helpContSens.gif" border=1>
<p>Click on the function name to see more information:
<br><img src="images/helpContSensHitF1click.gif" border=1>

</ol>
<p>&nbsp;
<p>That's all folks.
