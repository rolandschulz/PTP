<h3>How-to: Use CDT xlC Error Parser</h3>
<p>The PTP Cell/B.E IDE (IDE) 
has integrations with the Cell BE GNU compilers and also with the Cell
BE XL compilers. The error messages printed by these compilers are
parsed by the appropriate error message parser in order to identify the
error information and properly show it in the graphical user interface,
making it easier for the developer to solve the problems the compilers
encountered in his/her source code.</p>
<p>The GNU C Compiler error message parser already comes integrated
with CDT. On the other hand, there wasn't support in CDT for the XL
C/C++ compiler error messages and hence PTP Cell/B.E IDE provides
its own XLC Error Parser. However, since CDT 3.1.2 it is provided an XL
C/C++ Error Parser to be installed from the CDT update site. If you
prefer to use this XL C/C++ Error Parser instead of the one provided by
PTP Cell/B.E IDE, you may follow the following instructions in
order to install CDT xlC Error Parser as it is not installed by default
when CDT is installed:</p>
<p>
<ol>
	<li>Install Java, Eclipse and CDT as described in steps 1 through
	4 of the <a href="ide_install.htm">PTP Cell/B.E IDE
	Installation Instructions</a>.It is important to notice that the <b>CDT
	xlC Error Parser</b> is available only since <b>CDT 3.1.2</b></li>
	<li>Start Eclipse. Make sure to start Eclipse with a user that has
	write permission to the Eclipse installation directory.
	<li>From the menu, choose <b>Help -> Software Updates -> Find
	and Install...</b></li>
	<li>Select <b>Search for new feature to install</b>, then press <b>Next</b>.



	
	<li>Click <b>New Remote Site...</b>.
	<li>Fill the <b>Name</b> field with a name that identifies the
	update site, e.g.<b>CDT Update Site</b>.
	<li>Fill the <b>URL</b> field with <pre>http://download.eclipse.org/tools/cdt/releases/callisto</pre></li>
	<li>Click <b>OK</b>. The recently created entry will appear
	selected in the <b>Sites to include in search</b> field.
	<li>Click <b>Finish</b> and follow the onscreen instructions.
</ol>
</p>
<p>After following the steps above, a <b>CDT xlC Error Parser</b>
entry will appear in the <b>Error Parser</b> tab that can be accessed
through <b>Window -> Preferences... -> C/C++ -> Make -> New Make
Projects</b> or in the <b>C/C++ Build</b> dialog page of a <b>Managed
Make C/C++</b> project Properties or in the <b>C/C++ Make Project</b> dialog
page of a <b>Standard Make C/C++</b> project Properties or in the final
dialog of the project creation wizard for <b>Managed Make C/C++</b> and
<b>Standard Make C/C++</b> projects. On this <b>Error Parser</b> tab the
user will be able to deselect PTP Cell/B.E IDE <b>XLC Error
Parser</b> and select the <b>CDT xlC Error Parser</b>.</p>
