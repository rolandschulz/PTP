<h3>ALF API Wizard</h3>

<p>As of version 3.0, the PTP Cell/B.E includes a wizard which allows users to easily create a Cell BE application that utilizes the Accelerated Library Framework (ALF) application programming interface (API). The ALF API provides a set of functions to a set of parallel problems on multi-core, host-accelerator type systems, such as the Cell BE processor. Features of ALF include data transfer management, parallel task management, double buffering, and data partitioning. The next section of the tutorial will walk you through an example use case of the ALF API Wizard.</p>
