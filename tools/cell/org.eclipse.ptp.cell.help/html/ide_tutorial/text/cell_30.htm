<h3>Create Local Cell Simulator</h3>

<p>Now that the projects are created and properly configured, we can test our program, but first, a Cell environment must be created and started. The Cell IDE integrates IBM's full-system simulator for the Cell BE processor into eclipse, so that your only a few clicks away from testing your application on a Cell environment, even if you don't have access to a physical Cell processor. </p>
<p>In the <b>Remote Environments</b> view at the bottom, right click on <b>Local Cell Simulator</b> and select <b>Create</b>.
