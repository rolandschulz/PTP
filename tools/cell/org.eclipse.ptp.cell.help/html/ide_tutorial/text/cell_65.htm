<h3>Wizard Complete</h3>

<p>The three new projects have now been created, the generated source code has been imported, and the projects' properties have been configured to include the necessary libraries and to enable embed SPU functionality. Looking at the source code, you will notice that the wizard has generated code to handle many trivial tasks, like input/output transfer list preparation, but you will have to write your own code for the computing kernel and data initialization.</p>
