<h2>Data Transfer Entries</h2>
<p>The partitions will be eventually turned into a series of <b>data transfer entries</b>. 
After partitioning, each buffer/array must have an equal number of data transfer entries.</p>
<p>The number of data transfer (DT) entries for a buffer is computed as follows:<ul>
<li>One dimensional: # DT = (dimension_size_x / distribution_size_x)</li>
<li>Two dimensional: # DT = (dimension_size_x / distribution_size_x) * (dimension_size_y / distribution_size_y)</li>
<li>Three dimensional: # DT = (dimension_size_x / distribution_size_x) * (dimension_size_y / distribution_size_y) * (dimension_size_z / distribution_size_z)</li>
</ul></p>
<p>The following examples illustrate some valid and invalid data distributions for the arrays: A[1024][512] and B[512][128].
<ul>
<li>(CYCLIC(512), CYCLIC(16)) onto A, and (CYCLIC(128), CYCLIC(8)) onto B is valid, because the number of DT entries for these two distributions
are equal. (For A, the number of DT entries are (1024 / 512) * (512 / 16), and for B, the number of DT entries are (512 / 128) * (128 / 8))</li>
<li>(*, CYCLIC(16)) onto A, and (CYCLIC(128), CYCLIC(16)) onto B is valid, because the number of DT entries for these distributions are equal (32).</li>
<li>(CYCLIC(512), CYCLIC(16)) onto A, and (CYCLIC(128), CYCLIC(16)) onto B is invalid, because the number of DT entries for these two distributions is not equal.</li>
</ul>
