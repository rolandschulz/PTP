<h1> Setup for PTP UPC Tools </h1>

<p>The basic setup for the UPC tools is the same
as for the <a href="setup.html">MPI and OpenMP tools setup</a>.
Essentially, point CDT at the header files and at the command
to call your compiler with the UPC information.
<p>The UPC preferences should be set to point to your UPC header file.

<br>You may need to manually alter the project build properties (in the project properties) to add compiler 
and linker flags specific to UPC to your project.
