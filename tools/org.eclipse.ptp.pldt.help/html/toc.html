<h1> <img src="images/mpiLg.gif">PTP Parallel Language Development Tools </h1>
<p>The PTP Parallel Language Development Tools Eclipse plug-in provides
tools to aid in MPI Programming and other parallel languages and tools.
<ul>
<li>Analysis of C and C++ code to determine the location of MPI and OpenMP Artifacts
<li>"Artifact View" indicates locations of Artifacts found
in source code
<li>Navigation between the  Artifacts
<li>Reference information about the MPI and OpenMP calls via F1 (Ctl-F1, Help on Linux/Mac)
<li>Content assist via Cntl-Space
<li>Hover help 
</ul>
<h2>
Pre-requisites:
</h2>
<p>This plug-in requires the base Eclipse platform, the CDT, and MPI.
<ul>
<li><b>Eclipse</b> platform: Version  3.1 
<li><b>CDT:</b>
Version 3.0.x, or FDT/Photran (for C/C++ files.  Wherever CDT is mentioned, FDT projects and files,
for C/C++, should also work)

<li><b>MPI:</b>
Get MPI and its header file, a version that runs on
your system (e.g. MPICH2 for win32)
<ul>
<li>Make sure it's in your path 
<li>You may need to install it in a directory such that there are no spaces in the path
(that is, not in 'Program Files' etc.)
</ul>
<li><b>OpenMP:</b>
The PTP OpenMP tools merely need the OpenMP header file, similar to the MPI
pre-requisites above.

</ul>
<p>


<h2>Help Topics</h2>
<p>The following instructions describe setup and run for the MPI tools.
The OpenMP tools are almost identical except where noted.
