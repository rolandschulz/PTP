<h1> <img src="images/mpiLg.gif">PTP Parallel Language Development Tools </h1>
<p>Version 1.1
<p>The PTP Parallel Language Development Tools Eclipse plug-in provides
tools to aid in MPI Programming and other parallel languages and tools.
<ul>
<li>Analysis of C and C++ code to determine the location of MPI and OpenMP Artifacts
<li>"Artifact View" indicates locations of Artifacts found
in source code
<li>Navigation to source code location of artifacts
<li>Reference information about the MPI and OpenMP calls via F1 (Cntl-F1 on Linux; Help key on Mac)
<li>Content assist via Cntl-Space
<li>Hover help 
<p>The newest features include:
<li>OpenMP problems view of common errors, OpenMP "show #pragma region" action,
OpenMP "Show Concurrency" action.
<li>CDT "New Managed Make C Project" wizard includes a new wizard page that can 
automatically add in the include paths etc. for MPI projects.
</ul>
<h2>
Pre-requisites:
</h2>
<p>This plug-in requires the base Eclipse platform, the CDT, and MPI and/or OpenMP.
<ul>
<li><b>Eclipse</b> platform: Version  3.2 or later
<li><b>CDT:</b>
Version 3.1 or later for C/C++ files.  (Wherever CDT is mentioned, Photran projects and files,
for C/C++, should also work)

<li><b>MPI:</b>
Get MPI and its header file, a version that runs on
your system (e.g. OpenMPI for Linux/Mac; MPICH2 for win32)
<ul>
<li>Make sure it's in your path 
<li>You may need to install it in a directory such that there are no spaces in the path
(that is, not in 'Program Files' etc.)
</ul>
<li><b>OpenMP:</b>
The PTP PLDT OpenMP tools also  need the OpenMP header file, similar to the MPI
pre-requisites above.

</ul>
<p>Note that <i>running</i> MPI or OpenMP is not really required for the PLDT
to function and provide analysis and help with MPI and OpenMP development.
Just the header files are required in order to know which "artifacts" should
be located.
<p>To run the core part of PTP (Parallel Tools Platform, <a href="http://eclipse.org/ptp">http://eclipse.org/ptp</a>,
to run and debug parallel programs), you need whatever runtime it requires.  Currently 
(November 2006) this is OpenMPI, which is available for Linux and Mac Only.  
But for PLDT, this is not required, and PLDT will work
on Windows as well.
