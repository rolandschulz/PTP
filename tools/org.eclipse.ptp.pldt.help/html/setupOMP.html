<h1> Setup for PTP OpenMP Tools Plug-in</h1>

<p>Note: in order to have the OpenMP tools recognize #pragmas,
you must install a slight fix to CDT.
<p>CDT 3.0.x 
<a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=133723">
Bugzilla entry # 133723 </a> contains the 2-line patch.
Without this, the rest of the plug-in functions, but pragmas
will not be recognized.  This patch will be included in the
next (3.1) release of CDT.
<p>The basic setup for the OpenMP tools is the same
as for the <a href="setup.html">MPI tools setup</a>.
Essentially, point CDT at the header files and at the command
to call your compiler with the OpenMP information.
