<h1> Setup for PTP OpenMP Tools </h1>

<p>The basic setup for the OpenMP tools is the same
as for the <a href="setup.html">MPI tools setup</a>.
Essentially, point CDT at the header files and at the command
to call your compiler with the OpenMP information.
<p>Note that you must add the OpenMP include information manually to
the project. The New Project wizard does not (yet) add this
information automatically for OpenMP projects.
<p>Now set up to <a href="runOMP.html">run the OpenMP features</a>.
