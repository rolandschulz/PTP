<h1> <img src="images/analyze.gif"> PLDT - New and Noteworthy </h1>
<p>What's new in 3.0
<ul>
<li>MPI Artifact recognition does not have to rely on include files matching - preference page has (default) option to recognize
MPI artifacts by prefix MPI_ only.  This was a frequent problem experienced by new users.
<li>OpenMP New Project Wizard has improved more basic hello world example, and correctly sets up -fopenmp directive for gcc
<li>MPI Barrier markers can be removed.
</ul>
<p>What's new in 2.1
<ul>
<li>Smarter New Project Wizards set up more options, and prompt to set up
PLDT preferences if needed.
