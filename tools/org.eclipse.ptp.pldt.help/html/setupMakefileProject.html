<h2>Makefile vs. C projects</h2>
<p>When you use the CDT new project wizards,
you will see several types of projects.
A regular "C Project," for example, will create and manage the makefile and building for you.
This is sometimes called a "Managed Build" Project.
<p>If you want to provide your own makefile, you will create a "Makefile project"
and create the makefile within that project.

<p>For a Makefile project, the Project Properties look a bit different.
To bring up the project properties dialog, rightMouse on the project in the Project Explorer view,
and choose "Properties" at the bottom of the context menu.

<p>Set up the includes to point to your MPI (or OpenMP, or UPC, or LAPI) include path.
<p>You set up the PLDT preferences the same way as for regular C (Managed Build) projects.
