<h1> Setup for PTP MPI Tools</h1>

<p>Launch Eclipse with the PTP Parallel Language Development
Tools feature.

<p>The CDT (or FDT) plug-ins are also required.
<ol>
<li>Create a CDT project (e.g. Managed Make C Project)
<li>Create a source file e.g. test.c with MPI artifacts 
(see a small sample MPI program here: <a href="testMPI.c">testMPI.c</a>).

<li>Set up the include paths etc:
<br>Project Properties, C/C++ Build, Configuration Settings,
Tool Settings tab, Directories
<br>--> Add include path for mpi header files etc. - path to the 'include' dir
<br><img src="images/include.gif">
<p>
Project Properties, C/C++ Build, Configuration Settings,
Tool Settings tab, GCC C Linker, Libraries
<ol>
<li>Under "Libraries (-l)"  add the symbol "mpi"  
<li> Under "Library search path (-L)" add the path to the 'lib' dir in MPI dir.

</ol>
<p>
<li>Make sure the Indexer is turned on
<br>Project Properties, C/C++ Indexer, select "Full C/C++ Indexer (declarations and cross references)"
<br>And also the same in Window, Prefs, C/C++, Indexer (this seems to be the
default setting for new projects)
<p>
<li>Tell the plug-in where to find the MPI header file
<p>Window, Preferences, MPI
<br>Add path to MPI include paths (again) - this tells it what symbols to look
for in the MPI Artifact view.

</ol>

<p>Now set up to <a href="run.html">run the MPI plug-in</a>
