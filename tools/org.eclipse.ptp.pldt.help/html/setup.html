<h1>Setup for MPI Tools within the Parallel Language Development Tools</h1>

<p>To use  the PTP Parallel Language Development
Tools feature for MPI development, you need to 
<ol>
<li><a href="#prefs">Specify the MPI include path in preferences</a>, and</li>
<li><a href="#project">Add the MPI include files etc.  to the build information for each  project.</a>
</ol>

<h2 id="prefs">Specifying the MPI Include path in Preferences</h2>
<p>To specify the MPI include path, use Window > Preferences.
Under PTP, Parallel Language Development Tools, MPI...
(Note: If you do not have core PTP installed, the "Parallel Language 
Development Tools" section in the preferences will be included without it.)

<p>Add the path to MPI include paths  - this tells PLDT what symbols to look
for in the MPI Artifact view.  You can also specify the default MPI build command.
These values will make the MPI New Project Wizard page make more
accurate predictions of settings for new projects.

<h2 id="project">Add MPI Include paths to each project</h2>
<p>The MPI include paths must also be added to each project.
There are two ways to do this.
<ol>
<li><a href="#wizard">Use the MPI new project wizard</a>, or
</li>
<li><a href="#manual">Add the build information manually</a>.
</ol>
<h2 id="wizard">Use the MPI new project wizard</h2>
<p>Create a new "Managed Make C Project."
After the "Additional Project settings" wizard page,
you should see the "MPI Project Settings" wizard page.
<p>(Note: we plan to add a "New MPI project" project type later.)
<br>

<p>If you have configured the Preferences as described above,
the MPI include paths and other settings should be automatically included.
To <i>not</i> include the settings in the build configuration,
uncheck the first box "Add MPI project settings to this project".
If you want MPI settings but the settings for this project should be different,
uncheck the "Use default information" and
correct the information.


<h2 id="manual">Add the Build Information Manually</h2>
<p>If the new project wizard isn't used as described 
above to set the MPI information for a project,
the MPI information can be added to the project manually as follows.
<ol>
<li>Create a CDT project (e.g. Managed Make C Project)

<li>Set up the include paths etc:
<br>Project Properties, C/C++ Build, Configuration Settings,
Tool Settings tab, Directories
<br>--> Add include path for mpi header files etc. - path to the 'include' dir
<br><img src="images/include.gif">
<p>
Project Properties, C/C++ Build, Configuration Settings,
Tool Settings tab, GCC C Linker, Libraries
<ol>
<li>Under "Libraries (-l)"  add the symbol "mpi"  
<li> Under "Library search path (-L)" add the path to the 'lib' dir in MPI dir.
<br><img src="images/lib.gif">
<li><b>MPI Build Command:</b> Note: If you have an MPI installed that requires a different
build command, such as 'mpicc' instead of 'gcc', specify it here as well.
Select the compiler tool on the left and modify the 'Command:' value.
You probably also need to do the same for the linker tool.

</ol>

<p>Now set up to <a href="run.html">run the MPI plug-in</a>
