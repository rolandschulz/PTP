<h1> Setup for PTP MPI Tools</h1>

<p>To use  the PTP Parallel Language Development
Tools feature for MPI development, you need to 
<ol>
<li><a href="#prefs">Specify the MPI include path in preferences</a>, and</li>
<li><a href="#project">Add the MPI include files etc.  to the build information for each  project.</a>
</ol>

<h2 id="prefs">Specifying the MPI Include path in Preferences</h2>
<p>To specify the MPI include path, use Window > Preferences.
Under PTP, Parallel Language Development Tools, MPI...
(Note: If you do not have core PTP installed, the "Parallel Language 
Development Tools" section in the preferences will be included without it.)

<p>Add the path to MPI include paths  - this tells PLDT what symbols to look
for in the MPI Artifact view.
<br><img src="images/includeMPI.gif">
<p>Note: by doing this first, PLDT will find the include path
for the MPI New Project wizard automatically.


<h2 id="project">Add MPI Include paths to each project</h2>
<p>The MPI include paths must also be added to each project.
There are two ways to do this.
<ol>
<li><a href="#wizard">Use the MPI new project wizard</a>, or
</li>
<li><a href="#manual">Add the build information manually</a>.
</ol>
<h2 id="wizard">Use the MPI new project wizard</h2>
<p>Create a new "Managed Make C Project."
After the "Additional Project settings" wizard page,
you should see the "MPI Project Settings" wizard page.
<p>(Note: we plan to add a "New MPI project" project type later.)
<br>
<img src="images/mpiWizard.gif">
<p>If you have configured the Preferences as described above,
the MPI include paths should be automatically included.
To <i>not</i> include the paths in the build configuration,
uncheck the first box "Add MPI Include paths to this project".
If the include paths for this project should be different,
or if PLDT's estimation of the lib path location is incorrect,
uncheck the "Use default MPI include and lib information" and
correct the information.


<h2 id="manual">Add the Build Information Manually</h2>
<p>The MPI information can be added to the project manually as follows.
<ol>
<li>Create a CDT project (e.g. Managed Make C Project)
<li>Create a source file e.g. test.c with MPI artifacts 
(see a small sample MPI program here: <a href="testMPI.c">testMPI.c</a>).

<li>Set up the include paths etc:
<br>Project Properties, C/C++ Build, Configuration Settings,
Tool Settings tab, Directories
<br>--> Add include path for mpi header files etc. - path to the 'include' dir
<br><img src="images/include.gif">
<p>
Project Properties, C/C++ Build, Configuration Settings,
Tool Settings tab, GCC C Linker, Libraries
<ol>
<li>Under "Libraries (-l)"  add the symbol "mpi"  
<li> Under "Library search path (-L)" add the path to the 'lib' dir in MPI dir.
<br><img src="images/lib.gif">
</ol>
<p>

</ol>

<p>Now set up to <a href="run.html">run the MPI plug-in</a>
