<h1 id="top"> UPC New Project Wizards and Toolchains</h1>

<p>There are now at least two new project wizards and toolchains for using UPC that are (optional) features of CDT.
<ul>
<li>Berkeley UPC
<li>IBM XLUPC 
</ul>
<p>Since these are part CDT, we only mention them briefly here.

<p>Be sure the toolchain on the right side of the wizard selection page is used to
select the correct toolchain for your platform.
