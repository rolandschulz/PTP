<h1 id="top"> Running PTP UPC Tools Plug-in</h1>

<p>The basic instructions for running the UPC tools 
(finding UPC artifacts, navigating to source code, using Help)
are the same
as for <a href="run.html">running the MPI tools.</a>.

<p>Set up UPC Preferences. Here you can specify the UPC include file location.
This is used for the PLDT analysis feature (not for building).
It helps to determine whether APIs and other artifacts are related to UPC.
Alternatively, if you leave the checkbox selected indicating "Recognize APIs by prefix (upc_) alone?"
then the header file is not used.  This is a much simpler setup and seems less error prone.
So if the checkbox is checked, PLDT does not need the header file to find UPC artifacts.

UPC language features are highlighted by CDT.
