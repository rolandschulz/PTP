download eclipse & install
   from CD
   update site (from CD)
   also cover zip install
   overview of other tools (python) diff languages etc.
   
CD reqmts:
   cvs repose?
   sample project case study (non-mpi program in C at first)
       sample mpi projecgt
   eclipse 3.2
   update site with CDT & PTP
   cygwin - gcc etc.
   MPI: openMPI, mpich2  (or use mpich2 for all environments?)
       pre-built version of mpich for linux? RPM & macOS install
   
   
eclipse overview, history

need a case study
quick eclipse overview
   persp, view, editor
   
   std make project
   open src file, basic editor intro
   build
   
   case study in cvs?  on CD? does that work?
   create cvs repos, check out project, switch to CDT, project explorer, open file, ecitor,
           do build, launch config, run
   
3 types machines
   win, linux, mac
   can run mpich on win now; just can't debug. maybe by tutorial????
           openMPI also being done for win.
   
Recap
   chckout from cvs
   proj explorer, simple editing, build, run, debug of sample project
       - sample project in C

Module for each feature in more detail
   other menu options
   searching, content assist, refactoring (rename in C)
   problems view, markers....
   debugging - whole module on debugging
       debugging in cdt alone as well

Non-parallel intro done
discuss parallel 
    checkout parallel 
    OpenMPI language support
    Will new proj wiz be done? prob. not
    PTP intro 
    PLDT features
    build MPI program
    
    Introduce PTP
    ptp runtime persp. 
        (mpich startup multiple mpd (daemons?) to see >1 nodes?
    machines view, jobs view, etc.
    
    PLDT module
    features
    build 
    parallel launch config, setup, choose number of nodes, launch
    paralle runtime view, see std out, see icons change
    
Parallel debugger (last module)
  if mpich works, lab - if not greg demo on OpenMPI
  
  
DO: contact Parallel 101 tutorial from last year,
will they include ptp in tools at the end?

At end of our tutorial:
   other tools: perf. analysis tools (tau, pe, etc)
   stress framework for other tools
   
   
Send these notes to greg. he'll create ppt modules

1. overview - eclipse history etc. who's involved
   tutorial outline
2. "download" and install (from cd) mpich, cygwin, etc setup too
3. intro to eclipse
4. fortran
5. intro to ptp
6. edit launch and run:PLDT, 
 launch config and run
 7. parallel debugging
 8. other tools
