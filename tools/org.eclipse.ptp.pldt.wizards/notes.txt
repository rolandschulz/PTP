plugin per mpi impl
  - can have diff. configurations e.g. for mpich2 compiled w/intel, etc.
     keeps the paths to the installation directory
     could be part of the installation of mpich e.g.
     part of the build process of the mpi installation? separate ./configure process?

TODO: how to query what toolchain installed? NO
       - query the plugin information (see above
       - toolchain picks up info from the plugin
       new mpi project, adds mpi toolchain. choose which mpi inst you want.
       build looks at info, works out path to setup, and do build with correct toolchain option.
       RUN - par. tools looks at current configuration selected and use that to launch pgm.
       
       resource mgr - launch job: sets path to mpi
       
       
       do diff. builds on same mpi project?
       - wiz page to select mpi inst for project (default selection)
       - and project properties allows change.
       - toolchain changes (e.g. mpi toolchain 
       - might need a toolchain per version of mpi installation
       (mpich, openMPI, POE)
       plugin provided adds toolchain for the particular mpi installation
       
Launch config
    parallel pgm
    select project
    automatically picks up which mpi is currently selected in that project, and use that
    (that's what it was built with)
    
Could build with diff. versions of mpi (e.g. Debug and Release - keeps both these)
    launch config allows slection between these configs
