<p>
ISP is a tool for formally verifying MPI programs. It can be used by anyone who can write
simple MPI C programs, and requires no special training. ISP allows you to formally verify your MPI C
programs automatically without any extra efforts on your part (apart from compiling and
making your examples) and flags the following errors:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Deadlocks</li>
    <li>Assertion violations</li>
    <li>Object leaks</li>
</ul>

<p>
In addition, it helps you understand as well as step through all relevant process interleavings
(schedules). Notice our use of the word ‘relevant’: even a short MPI program may have too many
(an “exponential number”) of interleavings. For example, an MPI program with five processes, each
containing five MPI calls, can have well in excess of 1000 interleavings. However, ISP generates
a new interleaving only when it represents a truly new (as yet unexamined) behavior of your program.
</p>

<h3>As examples:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        If an MPI program consisting of two processes issues point-to-point sends and non-wildcard
        receives to each other, then there is no observable difference (apart from performance or
        resource consumption) whether the sends are posted before each matching receive or vice
        versa; in this case, ISP will generate only one interleaving;
        </li>
    <li>
        If an MPI program consisting of three processes is such that the second process issues a
        sequence of wildcard receives, and the first and third process issue point-to-point sends
        to process two, then the exact non-deterministic choices of matches made at each step may
        affect the ensuing computation (including the conditional outcomes). In such programs, it
        is possible to force an exponential number of interleavings. In practice, here is how the
        results look (these examples come with the ISP distribution).
    </li>
    <li>
        For Parmetis [1], a 14,000+ line MPI program that makes 56,990 MPI calls for four ranks and
        171,956 calls for eight ranks, ISP needed to examine only one interleaving!
    </li>
    <li>
        For many tests in the Umpire test suite [2], conventional MPI testing tools missed deadlocks
        despite examining many schedules. ISP determined a minimal list of interleavings to examine,
        finding deadlocks whenever they existed (see our table of results at the URL given under [3]).
    </li>
    <li>
        For Madre [4], a naive algorithm – present in the current release of ISP – can result in n!
        interleavings. An improved algorithm called POE B in the upcoming release of ISP reduces this
        to one interleaving. Much like with existing partial order [5], ISP does not guarantee a
        minimalnumber of interleavings, although it comes pretty close to it.
    </li>
</ul>

<h3>How ISP Works:</h3>
<p>
ISP works by intercepting the MPI calls made by the target program and making decisions on when
to send these MPI calls to the MPI library. This is accomplished by the two main components of ISP:
the Profiler and the Scheduler. An overview of ISP’s components and their interaction with the
program as well as the MPI library is provided in Figure 1 below.
</p>

<b>Figure 1</b>
</center>

<h3>Profiler:</h3>
<p>
The interception of MPI calls is accomplished by compiling the ISP Profiler together with
the target program’s source code. The Profiler makes use of MPI’s profiling mechanism
(PMPI). Then the Profiler provides its own version of MPI <i>f</i> (replacing the original) for each corresponding MPI function <i>f</i>. Within
each of these MPI <i>f</i> , the profiler communicates with the scheduler using TCP sockets to
send information about the MPI call the process wants to make. It will then wait for the
scheduler to make a decision on whether to send the MPI call to the MPI library or to
postpone it until later. When the permission to fire <i>f</i> is given from the scheduler, the
corresponding PMPI <i>f</i> will be issued to the MPI run-time. Since all MPI libraries come
with functions such as PMPI <i>f</i> for every MPI function <i>f</i>, this approach provides a portable
and light-weight instrumentation mechanism for MPI programs being verified [6].
</p>

<h3>Scheduler:</h3>
<p>
The ISP Scheduler helps carry out the POE algorithm. As it turns out, the POE algorithm is
based on exploiting MPI’s out-of-order completion semantics. In other words,
</p>
 
<ul>
    <li>
        (i) Not all MPI operations issued by a process complete in that order.
    </li>
    <li>
        (ii) A proper modeling of this out of-order completion semantics is essential in
        order to meet goals G1 and G2. For example, two MPI_Isend commands issued in
        succession by an MPI process P1 to the same target process (say P2) are forced to
        match in order, whereas if these MPI_Isends are targeted to two different MPI
        processes, then they may match contrary to the issue order. As another example,
        any operation following an MPI_Barrier must complete only after the barrier has
        completed, while an operation issued before the barrier may linger across the
        barrier, and actually complete after the barrier [6]!
    </li>
</ul>

<h3>Description of POE Algorithm:</h3>
<p>POE stands for &#X201C;POR with out-of-order and elusive interleavings" </P>
<P>
MPI programs suffer from &#X201C;elusive" interleavings in the presence of MPI
wildcard Receive <I>R</I>(*) . Issuing the MPI sends in different orders does not
help as the MPI runtime provides no guarantees based on when the Send is
actually issued. POE employs dynamic source re-writing in place of wildcard
so that every interleaving explored by POE algorithm is deterministic. Also,
the presence of collectives such as <CODE>MPI\_Barrier</CODE> can cause traditional
runtime verification techniques such as &#X201C;Dynamic Partial Order Reduction" to
fail since it is not always possible to issue instructions in different orders
in the presence of collectives. POE also addresses this issue by creating
&#X201C;match sets".
</P>

<P>
POE algorithm works by creating a graph structure with the MPI operations of
processes as nodes and by adding <EM>Intra-Completes-Before</EM> (IntraCB) edges
between these nodes. As the name suggests, IntraCB edges are only added between
the MPI operations within the MPI processes. The IntraCB edges are added
between the MPI operations based on the MPI semantics of the operations. MPI
functions like <CODE>MPI_Barriers</CODE>, <CODE>MPI_Wait</CODE> etc have the semantics,
that no later MPI operations can be issued until these MPI operations complete.
We call such operations as <EM>fence operations</EM>. Note that instructions
issued before the fence operations can linger even after the fence operation
is complete. </P><P>The IntraCB edges are added based on the following rules:
Let <I>i</I> and <I>j</I> be the MPI operations of a process <I>P</I> such that <I>i</I> &lt; <I>j</I> (i.e.,
<I>i</I> comes before <I>j</I> in the program order. There is an IntraCB edge between <I>i</I>
and <I>j</I> is one of the following is true:
</P>

<UL>
    <LI><I>i</I> is a <EM>fence</EM> operation.</LI>
    <LI><I>i</I> and <I>j</I> are send operations and the destination of <I>i</I> and <I>j</I> are the same</LI>
    <LI><I>i</I> and <I>j</I> are receive operations and the source of <I>i</I> and <I>j</I> are the same</LI>
    <LI><I>i</I> is a wildcard receive operation and <I>j</I> is a receive operation.</LI>
</UL>

<P>
If there is a path from <I>i</I> to <I>j</I> then <I>i</I> is called the ancestor of <I>j</I>. POE
algorithm uses these IntraCB edges to form <EM>match-sets</EM> to be issued into
the MPI runtime. The following is the (informal) algorithm:</P><P>An MPI operation is &#X201C;matched"
if it has been issued to the MPI runtime by the POE algorithm.
</P>

<OL CLASS="enumerate" type=1>
    <LI>Run the MPI processes until they all reach fence operations.</LI>
    <LI>Let <I>e</I> denote the MPI operations of all processes such that for each <I>i</I> &#X2208; <I>e</I>, all ancestors of <I>i</I> have been matched.</LI>
    <LI>Let <I>m</I> denote the match-sets formed out of <I>e</I> as follows:
    <UL>
        <LI>
            <B>SR-Match:</B> <I>i</I>, <I>j</I> &#X2208; <I>e</I> such that <I>i</I> and <I>j</I> are send and receive
            operations where source (destination) of <I>i</I> is equal to the destination
            (source)j, then &#X27E8; <I>i</I>, <I>j</I>&#X27E9; form a match set.
        </LI>
        <LI>
            <B>SR*-Match</B> If <I>i</I> is a wildcard receive and <I>j</I><SUB>1</SUB>,<I>j</I><SUB>2</SUB>&#X2026; <I>j</I><SUB><I>n</I></SUB> are the matching
            sends, then create the match-sets as {&#X27E8; <I>i</I>, <I>j</I><SUB>1</SUB>&#X27E9;, &#X27E8; <I>i</I>,
            <I>j</I><SUB>2</SUB>&#X27E9;, &#X2026; &#X27E8; <I>i</I>, <I>j</I><SUB><I>n</I></SUB>&#X27E9;}. Each element of the set is issued as a different interleaving.
        </LI>
        <LI>
            <B>C-Match:</B> If <I>i</I><SUB>1</SUB>,<I>i</I><SUB>2</SUB>&#X2026; <I>i</I><SUB><I>n</I></SUB> are the same collective operation of <I>n</I> processes
            then &#X27E8; <I>i</I><SUB>1</SUB>, <I>i</I><SUB>2</SUB>, &#X2026;, <I>i</I><SUB><I>n</I></SUB>&#X27E9; form a match set.
        </LI>
        <LI>
            <B>W-Match</B>If <I>i</I> is an <CODE>MPI_Wait</CODE>, then &#X27E8; <I>i</I> &#X27E9; forms a match set.
        </LI>
    </UL>
    </LI>
    <LI>
        Issue the match sets to MPI runtime in the following priority order: <EM>C-Match &gt; W-Match &gt; SR-Match &gt; SR*-Match</EM>.
    </LI>
    <LI>
        If any of the processes issued a fence operation then goto step 1. Else, goto step 4. 
    </LI>
    <LI>
        If there are no match sets and all processes have issued <CODE>MPI_Finalize</CODE>, check if any wildcard match sets are yet to be explored. If yes, then restart the processes and goto step 1, otherwise, exit.
    </LI>
    <LI>
        If there are no match sets and there is atleast one process that has not issued <CODE>MPI_Finalize</CODE>, then there is a deadlock. Flag a deadlock and kill all the MPI processes.
    </LI>  
</OL>

<h3>Source Code Analyzer</h3>
<p>
This is a unique user interface which visually displays the output that ISP generated by highlighting
lines in the source file. It shows both the current MPI call, and any matching point-to-point
or collective operation. It also allows the user to examine MPI calls for a particular rank with
an easy to use <b>Rank Locking</b> feature.
</p>

<p>
The source code analyzer also allows examination of flagged errors with one click. The <b>Examine Error</b>
feature will highlight the problem line in the source code within the Eclipse editor. In addition, it offers
features to browse calls by rank and by interleaving as well as listing any resource leaks found in the
source code. One click on the flagged leak in the <b>Resource Leak Browser</b> takes the user to the suspect line
of code in the Eclipse editor.
