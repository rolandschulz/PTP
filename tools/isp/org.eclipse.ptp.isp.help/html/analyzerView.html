<h2>Activating the Analyzer View</h2>
<p>
Once you run the Analyzer the Analyzer View will automatically be brought to the 
foreground. Any of the following will enable the source code analyzer:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        From the Project Explorer window, right click on the C/C++ source code file and select
        <img height="16" src="images/trident.gif" width="13" /><b>Formally Verify MPI Program</b>
        from the ISP context menu.
    </li>
    <li>
        Open the source code file in the Eclipse editor window and right click
        <img height="16" src="images/trident.gif" width="13" /><b>Formally Verify MPI Program</b>
        from the ISP context menu.
    </li>
    <li>
        Open the source code file in the Eclipse editor window and select
        <img height="16" src="images/trident.gif" width="13" /><b>Formally Verify MPI Program</b>
        from the trident dropdown icon on the Eclipse toolbar.
    </li>
    <li>
        Open the file in the editor, click on ISP from the ISP menu item, and select
        <img height="16" src="images/trident.gif" width="13" /><b>Formally Verify MPI Program</b>
    </li>
    <li>
        Open the file in the editor and execute the key combo "CTRL+6".
    </li>
</ul>

<br>

<h2>Setting the Number of Processes</h2>
<p>
To set the number of processes for a particular run of ISP, any of the following will work:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        Open the source code file in the Eclipse editor window and select
        <img height="16" src="images/triple-trident.gif" width="13" /><b>Set Number of Processes</b>
        from the trident dropdown icon on the Eclipse toolbar.
    </li>
    <li>
        Open the file in the editor, click on ISP from the ISP menu item, and select
        <img height="16" src="images/triple-trident.gif" width="13" /><b>Set Number of Processes</b>
    </li>
    <li>
        Open the file in the editor and execute the key combo "CTRL+5".
    </li>
</ul>

<br>
<center>
<img src="images/runNumProcs.png">
</center>
<br><br>

<p>
An input dialog will allow you to enter the desired number of processes, which will persist until you
change the value again.

<h2>Source Code Analyzer Overview</h2>
<p>
This is a unique user interface which visually displays the output that ISP generated by highlighting
lines in the source file. It shows both the current MPI call, and any matching point-to-point
or collective operation. It also allows the user to examine MPI calls for a particular rank with
an easy to use <b>Rank Locking</b> feature.
</p>

<p>
The source code analyzer also allows examination of flagged errors with one click. The <b>Browse Errors</b>
feature will open a shell that allows highlighting of individual source code lines involved with the error within the Eclipse editor.
In addition, it offers features to browse calls by rank and by interleaving as well as listing any resource leaks found in the
source code. One click on the flagged leak in the <b>Resource Leak Browser</b> takes the user to the suspect line
of code in the Eclipse editor.
</p>

<p>
The image below shows what the Code Analyzer View should look like along with an explanation of its components.
</p>

<img src="images/analyzerIntegration.jpg" width="800" height="607"/>

<h2>Transitions</h2>
<p>
A transition is essentially an abstraction of an MPI call along with information regarding how the call
effects the state of the system. The top left section (aptly titled &quot;Transitions&quot;) lets
the user change which transition is currently being viewed.
</p>

The buttons from left to right let the user navigate to the: 
<ul>
    <li><img height="16" src="images/first-item.gif" width="16" /> first transition</li>
    <li><img height="16" src="images/prev-item.gif" width="16" /> previous transition</li>
    <li><img height="16" src="images/next-item.gif" width="16" /> next transition</li>
    <li><img height="16" src="images/last-item.gif" width="16" /> last transition</li>
</ul>

<p>
Just to the right of the transition/interleaving buttons is a drop down menu that lets the user lock a 
rank.&nbsp; If no ranks are locked then the calls will be stepped through in issue order or program order
on the preference setting related to this feature (Step Calls in Issue Order). The Lock Rank option
allows the user to only step to the previous and next call of a specific rank, instead of all the ranks
</p>

<h2>Interleavings</h2>
<p>
An interleaving is a schedule of transitions, or in other words a possible 
ordering of MPI calls issued by the scheduler. The top right section (titled &quot;Interleavings&quot;)
lets the user change which interleaving is being viewed. Doing this will automatically 
move to the first transition of the new interleaving. These buttons let the user choose which
interleaving is currently being navigated.
</p>

The buttons from left to right let the user navigate to the: 
<ul>
    <li><img height="16" src="images/first-item.gif" width="16" /> first interleaving</li>
    <li><img height="16" src="images/prev-item.gif" width="16" /> previous interleaving</li>
    <li><img height="16" src="images/next-item.gif" width="16" /> next interleaving</li>
    <li><img height="16" src="images/last-item.gif" width="16" /> last interleaving</li>
</ul>

<h2>Step Order for MPI Calls</h2>
<p>

An interleaving is a schedule of transitions, or in other words a possible 
ordering of MPI calls issued by the scheduler. The top right section (titled &quot;Interleavings&quot;)
lets the user change which interleaving is being viewed. Doing this will automatically 
move to the first transition of the new interleaving. These buttons let the user choose which
interleaving is currently being navigated.
</p>

The radio buttons from left to right do the following:
<ul>
    <li><b>Internal Issue Order:</b> Step through MPI calls in the order they were issued to the MPI runtime by the scheduler</li>
    <li><b>Program Order:</b> Step through MPI calls in the order they appear in the code</li>
</ul>

<h2>Detailed Runtime Information</h2>
<p>
On the far left are two labels. The one on the top explains how the 
program terminated (whether by a deadlock, assertion violation, or without 
error). The bottom one reports whether or not any resource leaks were found. For 
both of these messages, the text is green if the nothing is wrong and red when it 
is reporting a problem.
</p>

<h3>Button Explanations</h3>
<p>
<img height="16" src="images/setNumProcsCombo.gif" width="16" /> The first drop down combo-box shows the current number of
processes and lets the user choose a new value for the next run of the analyzer.
</p>

<p>
<img height="16" src="images/ui-trident.gif" width="16" /> This button will launch ispUI, a.k.a. JavaGUI, a graphical tool
for examining all processes at once and their interactions on a more global level. Please reference the
<a href="javaGui.html">JavaGUI page</a> for a detailed overview on its use.

</p>

<p>
<img height="16" src="images/browse.gif" width="16" /> <b>Browse MPI Calls</b><br>
This opens a new window that shows all MPI Calls and groups them first by the rank that issued
them and then by the Interleaving they are found in.<br>
<ul>
    <li>
        Blue highlighted lines represent calls that are currently highlighted in the code windows.
    </li>
    <li>
        Red highlighted lines represent calls that did NOT complete due to an error.
    </li>
</ul>
<img src="images/callBrowser.jpg"><br>
</p>

<p>
<img height="16" src="images/browse.gif" width="16" /> <b>Browse Leaks</b><br>
If no resource leaks were found then this button is disabled and the text changes to <font COLOR="#00c800">No Leaks Found</font>
If there are any leaks then clicking on it will prompt a new window that lists all leaks.If you 
click on a leak in this new window, the source file will be opened in the editor and the line where
the leak is found will be selected (this is done to help you find and fix the problem).<br><br>
<img src="images/resourceLeakBrowser.jpg"><br>
</p>

<p>
<img height="16" src="images/goto-error.gif" width="16" /> <b>Browse Errors</b><br>
This button is also disabled if there were no assertion violations or deadlocks. Clicking on it brings up
a shell that allows highlighting of individual source code lines involved with the error within the Eclipse editor. 
Some errors like deadlocks involve multiple lines of code.
</p>

<h3>Code Windows</h3>
<p>
At the top of this section are two labels that explain the MPI Call(s) 
currently being viewed. On the left is the explanation for the originating 
call and on the right is the explanation of the matching call (for example an 
MPI Send may match with an MPI Recv and in such a situation the Send will be 
described on the left and the Recv on the right). Many MPI Calls do not 
match with anything (like Barrier or Finalize for example) in this situation the 
label on the right will be blank.These labels have three pieces of 
information. From top to bottom they are: Rank (aka process id), the 
file and line number where it is found, and the complete MPI Call as it appears 
in the source file.
</p>

<p>
Below these two labels are two windows that both hold complete copies of the 
source file. These are used to visually show where the calls came from and how 
they match. In the left window the originating call is highlighted and on 
the right the matching call is highlighted.
</p>

<h3>ISP Code Analyzer View Options</h3>
This view's toolbar has a single help button:<br><br>
<img height="16" src="images/help-contents.gif" width="16">
Get ISP Analyzer Help - Opens the Eclipse help topic related to the ISP Code Analyzer View.

<p>
<b>Note:</b> This same functionality can be obtained through the context and pull-down menus for the view.
