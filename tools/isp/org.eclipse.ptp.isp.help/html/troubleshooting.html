<th>Problem</th><th>Solution</th>

<tr>
    <td>When I try to run ISP, the ISP Console reports <b>No such file or directory</b>.</td>
    <td>Make sure the paths to the ISP executable and other scripts are properly set on the ISP preference page</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>When I try to run ISP, I get an error message saying that an error occurred while trying to run ISP.</td>
    <td>If the error details say: “Cannot run program ISPCC” Then ISP was not installed properly.  Try re-installing ISP itself.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td><img src="images/ispExceptionDialog.png"><br></br><img src="images/uiExceptionDialog.png"></td>
    <td>You most likely have not set the paths to the ISP executable or one of its scripts properly in the 
    preference page. Make sure you don't have a trailing <b>&#34;&#47;&#34;</b> on any path. (e.g. &#47;usr&#47;local&#47;bin&#47;)
    Just use the browse buttons on the ISP preference page to safely navigate to the directory.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>I don’t see ISP in the menu, there is no trident icon anywhere, and the ISP Views do not exist.</td>
    <td>The Eclipse Plug-­in was not installed properly.  Try installing it again from <a href="http://eclipse.org/ptp/isp/">
        http://eclipse.org/ptp/isp</a>.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>While running ISP from the command line I get an error saying “Server unable to bind!”</td>
    <td>This means the specified port is in use. By default ISP starts at port 9999. Use the –p flag to specify a different port number.<br><br>
        <i>Those using the Eclipse plug­in do not need to worry about this problem. If port 9999 fails to bind the plug­in will search until
        it finds a port that is usable (leaving port numbers &#60; 1025 available to the system).</i></td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>I’m running Eclipse and when I try to running ISP, Eclipse becomes unresponsive.</td>
    <td>Make sure your process manager is running. The ISP Plug-in assumes your process manager is already running</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>I’m trying to view a log file in the Eclipse editor, and I get editor message saying that the file is out of sync with the file system.</td>
    <td>ISP has generates a new log file. Just hit F5 to refresh the Eclipse editor's view of the file.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>I can't find the log file ISP generated in my project.</td>
    <td>Refresh your project. It should be in a directory named &quot;isp&quot; at the same level as the source file.</td>
