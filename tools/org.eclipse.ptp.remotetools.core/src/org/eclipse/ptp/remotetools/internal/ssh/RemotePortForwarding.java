/**
 * Implementation of {@link IRemotePortForwarding} for SSH. Contains information
 * about from and to where the port forwarding was established. The information
 * is valid while the forwarding is active.
 * 
 * When creating the forwarding, the constructor assigns an execution manager as
 * owner of the port forwarding. When the port forwarding is turned off, then it
 * will is considered "inactive", it will have no execution manager anymore as
 * owner and the information won't be valid anymore.
 * The forwarding must be notified by that it was turned off by Remote Tools calling {@link #releaseOwner()}.
 * 
 * If the owner wasn't removed when turning off the connection, the an
 * application that stores a reference to the forwarding, would also indirectly
 * reference the execution manager, the connection and all data structure.
 * This would prevent garbage collection of connections that are not used anymore.
 * 
 * All methods have package visibility to allows internal access without getter/setters.
