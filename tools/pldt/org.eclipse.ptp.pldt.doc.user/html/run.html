<h1> Running the MPI Tools within the Parallel Language Development Tools</h1>
<p>To run the PTP PLDT MPI Tools, 
create a project (e.g a Managed Make C project), and
set the preferences and include paths as described in
<a href="setup.html">Setup for PTP MPI Tools</a>.

<p>The Parallel Language Development Tools work on Standard Make C projects as well, and
on C++ projects (Standard Make and Managed Make).  The description here is for
a Managed Make C Project.


<ol>
<li>Within the project, create a C file that includes MPI code. A sample is <a href="testMPI.c">testMPI.c</a> 

<p>Note: A sample C++ file with MPI calls 
is <a href="testMPIcpp.cpp">testMPIcpp.cpp</a>.
<br>A sample C++ file with MPI calls in ordinary C style 
is <a href="helloMPI_c_style.cpp">helloMPI_c_style.cpp</a>.


</ul>
<p>&nbsp;


<li>Select the source file to analyse, to find the MPI artifacts.
<p>Click the MPI button 
<img src="images/mpi.gif" border=1> in the tool bar.
<p><img src="images/mpiButtons.gif" >
<li>The MPI Artifact View is opened, if it was not present.
It is 
populated with MPI artifacts found.
<p><img src="images/mpiView.gif">

<p>If no artifacts are found, check that:
<ol>
<li>The MPI preferences page lists the include file for the MPI installation
that your source code uses.  This list is how the analysis determines what is
an "MPI artifact."  
<li>Your project properties have the include path (the same one listed
in the MPI preferences page) listed.
Note that the MPI analysis may require this even if 
the build procedure - such as  a build command like 'mpicc' - 
implicitly does this include for you during build.
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;
<li>Double click on any line in the MPI Artifact View
to navigate the editor to that line in the source file.
<p>&nbsp;
<li>Hover over the MPI Artifact identified in the source file
(by blue squiggles) to see additional information about that
function call, for example. 
<br><img src="images/hover.gif" border=1>
<li>Rows in the MPI Artifact View can be sorted by any of the columns.
Click on the column heading to sort.
<li>Click the "Clear MPI Artifacts Markers" button 
<img src="images/nompi.gif" border=1> in the tool bar to remove all
the MPI artifacts.
<li>You can run the analysis on another file and its markers
will be added to the view.
<li>You can run the analysis on more than one file (multiple selection)
or a container (folder or project), to analyse more than one file at a time.
Click on a project or a folder, then click the
MPI button 
<img src="images/mpi.gif" border=1> 
 to run it on all C source files in that folder.
<p>
<li><b>Content Assist</b><br>
Type an incomplete MPI function name e.g. "MPI_Ini"
and hit Ctrl-Space. The information that is shown
is populated with CDT completions including argument
types, but in addition, the PTP-MPI tools also provide
specific information about actual MPI constant values, etc.
where appropriate, and a yellow popup with additional 
textual descriptive information about the function.
<br><img src="images/contentAssist.gif" border=1>
<p>
<li><b>Content sensitive help</b><br>
Also, if F1 is pressed when the cursor is within
a function name, a help view appears which shows additional information.

<br><img src="images/helpContSensHitF1.gif" border=1>
<p>Help View appears:
<br><img src="images/helpContSens.gif" border=1>
<p>Click on the function name to see more information:
<br><img src="images/helpContSensHitF1click.gif" border=1>

</ol>

<p>That concludes the description of the MPI features.
