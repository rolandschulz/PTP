<h4>Description</h4>

<div class="ledi">
<p>This function waits for completion of all outstanding remote writes initiated from the
calling PE</p>
<p>Remote writes are issued by calls to shmem_put() and related put routines.</p>
<p>When controls returns from shmem_put(), the data is delivered to the
communication circuitry but has not yet arrived to the remote PE. The shmem_quiet
function does not return until all the data is delivered to the remote PE's memory.
