<h4>Synopsis</h4>
<p>

<pre> 
    #include &lt;upc.h&gt;
    int upc_lock_attempt(upc_lock_t *ptr);               
</pre>

<p>
<h4>Description</h4>

<p>
The <code>upc_lock_attempt</code>    function  attempts to set the state of the lock pointed
to by <code>ptr</code> to locked.
<p>If the lock is already in locked state due to the calling thread setting it to
locked state, the result is undefined.
<p>If the lock is already in locked state the function returns 0.
<p>If the lock is in state unlocked, a single calling thread sets the state to locked
and the function returns 1.
<p>A null strict access is implied after a call to upc_lock_attempt() that returns
1.
