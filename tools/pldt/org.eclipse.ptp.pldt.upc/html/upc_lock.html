<h2 >The <code>upc_lock</code> function   </h2>

<h4>Synopsis</h4>
<p>

<pre> 
    #include &lt;upc.h&gt;
    void upc_lock(upc_lock_t *ptr);                  
</pre>

<p>
<h4>Description</h4>

<p>
The <code>upc_lock</code>    function  sets the state of the lock pointed to by <code>ptr</code> to locked.
<p>If the lock is already in locked state due to the calling thread setting it to
locked state, the result is undefined.
<p>If the lock is already in locked state, then the calling thread waits for some
other thread to set the state to unlocked. 
<p>Once the lock is in state unlocked, a single calling thread sets the state to
locked and the function returns.
<p>A null strict access is implied after a call to upc_lock().
