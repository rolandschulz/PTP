<h4 id="top">UPC Terms, definitions and symbols</h4>
<p>
For the purpose of these specifications the following definitions apply.

<dl>
<dt><strong><strong>thread</strong></strong></dt>
<dd>
an instance of execution initiated by the execution environment at program
startup.</dd>

<dt><strong> </strong></dt>
<dd> </dd>

<dt><strong>object</strong></dt>
<dd>
region of data storage in the execution environment which can represent
values.</dd>

<dt><strong>shared object </strong></dt>
<dd>
an object allocated using a shared-qualified declarator or by a library function
defined to create shared objects. 
<p>Note: 
All threads may access shared objects.</dd>

<dt><strong>private object</strong></dt>
<dd>
any object which is not a shared object.
<p>Note: Each thread declares and creates its own private objects which no
other thread can access.</dd>
<dt><strong> shared array</strong></dt>
<dd>
an array with elements that have shared qualified type.
</dd>
<dt><strong>affinity</strong></dt>
<dd>
logical association between shared objects and threads. Each element of data
storage that contains shared objects has affinity to exactly one thread.
</dd>
<dt><strong>pointer-to-shared</strong></dt>
<dd>
a pointer whose referenced type is shared-qualified.
</dd>
<dt><strong> pointer-to-local</strong></dt>
<dd>
a pointer whose referenced type is not shared-qualified.
</dd>
<dt><strong>access</strong></dt>
<dd>
&lt;execution-time action&gt; to read or modify the value of an object by a thread.
<p>The file scope declaration int y; creates a separate object for each thread to access.
</dd>
<dt><strong>shared access</strong></dt>
<dd>
an access using an expression whose type is shared-qualified.</dd>
<dt><strong> strict shared read</strong></dt>
<dd>
a shared read access which is determined to be strict.</dd>
<dt><strong>strict shared write</strong></dt>
<dd>
a shared modify access which is determined to be strict </dd>
<dt><strong>relaxed shared read</strong></dt>
<dd>
a shared read access which is determined to be relaxed</dd>
<dt><strong>relaxed shared write</strong></dt>
<dd>
a shared modify access which is determined to be relaxed </dd>
<dt><strong>local access</strong></dt>
<dd>
an access using an expression whose type is not shared-qualified.
</dd>
<dt><strong>collective</strong></dt>
<dd>
a constraint placed on some language operations which requires evaluation
of such operations to be matched across all threads. The behavior of collective
operations is undefined unless all threads execute the same sequence of
collective operations.</dd>
<dt><strong>single-valued</strong></dt>
<dd>
an operand to a collective operation, which has the same value on every
thread. The behavior of the operation is otherwise undefined.</dd>
<dt><strong>phase</strong></dt>
<dd>
an unsigned integer value associated with a pointer-to-shared which indicates
the element-offset within an affinity block; used in pointer-to-shared
arithmetic to determine affinity boundaries</dd>
