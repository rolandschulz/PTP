/**
 * Options governing how remote proxy communication should work. The STDIO and 
 * PORT_FORWARDING options are mutually exclusive. MANUAL_LAUNCH is only available if
 * STDIO is *not* enabled.
 * 
 * No options -		Use sockets for each proxy server that is started (runtime or debug).
 * 
 * STDIO -			Multiplex all communication to a particular RM over a single connection
 * 					using the proxy standard input and output. This includes the runtime proxy, 
 * 					and any debug proxies started during the session.
 * 
 * PORT_FORWARDING-	Use sockets for each proxy server, but attempt to use port forwarding
 * (default) 		over the connection if supported.
 * 
 * MANUAL_LAUNCH -	Don't launch the proxy server automatically when the resource manager
 * 					is started. Instead, the command that would normally be executed is
 * 					displayed on the console and in the error log. The user can then
 * 					establish a manual connection and run this command. This is mainly used
 * 					for debugging the proxy server.
