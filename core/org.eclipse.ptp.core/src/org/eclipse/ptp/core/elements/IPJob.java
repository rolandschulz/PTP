 * A Job can be a parallel or sequential job, consisting of one or more
 * processes which are residing on Nodes. Jobs may span Machines, though this
 * may not be very common in reality, but the model allows for this. Finally, a
 * Job may or may not belong to the current user, it just means that if it is
 * visible then this user can see the Job in his or her Universe. This may have
 * ramifications on what the user can do to the Job if it is not owned by them.
