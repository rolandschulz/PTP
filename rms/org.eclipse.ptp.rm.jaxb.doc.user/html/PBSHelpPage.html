	<p>
		The PBS Eclipse plug-in, part of the <a
			href="PLUGINS_ROOT/org.eclipse.ptp.doc.user/html/toc.html">
			Parallel Tools Platform</a> (PTP), allows you to launch and monitor
		applications on local or remote PBS (Portable Batch System)
		Distributed Resource Managers.<br>
	</p>
	<!-- NEEDS UPDATING FOR PTP 6.0 -->
<p><b>Note:</b> PTP 6.0 does not require the creation of separate <i>Resource Managers</i>
and instead, the target configuration is specified on the Run Configuration dialog.
This document has not been updated for PTP 6.0, but the Resources tab on the
new Run Configuration menu should have approximately the same information as 
the Resource manager setup dialog described here, but this can vary depending on the 
target configuration / resource manager.

</ul>
<!--  -------------------------- -->
	<p>
		The PBS Resource Managers use the new configurable (JAXB) framework.
		(An in-detail explanation of the <a
			href="PLUGINS_ROOT/org.eclipse.ptp.rm.jaxb.doc.user/html/toc.html">JAXB
			Model</a> can be found in the PTP Developer Guide.) What follows here is
		a guide to the PBS-specific launch tabs. There are no special
		requirements to run the PBS Resource Managers.
		<!--  ; consult <a
			href="PLUGINS_ROOT/org.eclipse.ptp.doc.user/html/02resMgrSetup.html">Configuring
			Resource Managers</a> for general information on resource-manager
		requirements and set-up.

		<a name="ProvidedTypes"></a>Preconfigured PBS Resource Manager Types
	</h2>
	<p>
		PTP provides two generic PBS Resource Managers, one which is
		configured for batch submissions to the scheduler (<i>PBS-Generic-Batch</i>),
		and one for interactive PBS submissions using a pseudo-terminal (i.e.,
		"qsub -I"; <i>PBS-Generic-Interactive</i>). The settings in these
		configurations should work on most Torque systems and many PBS Pro
		setups, though there may be differences in some of the attributes for
		job submission which may have to be adjusted for depending on your
		local system.

	</p>
	<h2 style="text-align: left;">
		<a name="BatchSubmission"></a>Submission Using the PBS Batch Resource
		Manager
	</h2>
	<p>
		When you select the <i>PBS-Generic-Batch</i> manager, the Run
		Configuration will have a Resources Tab with three sub-tabs available
		for use.
	<p>
	<ul>
		<li><b>Basic PBS Settings</b>
		</li>
		<li><b>Advanced PBS Settings</b>
		</li>
		<li><b>Import PBS Script</b>
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		Each of these is an "independent" environment in the sense that the
		specific variables set on one are not necessarily included in the
		others, even though their underlying values are shared across all
		three tabs; <b><i>the tab from which you select "Run" is the
				environment that applies to the job</i> </b>.
	</p>
	<p>Thus if you use the Advanced Tab and set Job_Name to "pbs1",
		then switch to the Basic tab, you will see Job_Name set to "pbs1"
		there as well; however, if you launch from Basic, only the variables
		seen on the Basic tab will be included in the configuration and script
		for the job; any of the variables on the Advanced Tab not on the Basic
		Tab will revert to an undefined or default value.</p>

	<h3 style="text-align: left;">
		<a name="BasicTab"></a>Basic Settings
	</h3>
	<p>Below is a view of the Basic tab. Job_Name and Wallclock Time
		are validated fields, meaning that values with a specific syntax must
		be provided (there are defaults); an error message on the top left of
		the screen will appear in red in case these are incorrect. Hovering
		over the Name label will display a tooltip, if there is one for that
		attribute.</p>
	<br>
	<br>
	<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
		<img alt="BasicTab" src="images/02Basic.png"><br>
	</div>
	<br>
	<br>
	<p>At the left bottom of the tab there are three buttons, "View
		Script", "View Configuration" and "Restore Defaults". The first allows
		you to inspect what the batch script that is generated from the
		filled-in values will look like:</p>
	<br>
	<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
		<img alt="Configuration" src="images/04Script.png"><br>
	</div>
	<br>
	<br>
	<p>Similarly, the second button can be used to see the full
		configuration underlying this particular tab setting (this is the
		"environment" for the resource manager, and is useful to check to make
		sure the values you have set on the tab will be correctly reported to
		the resource manager):</p>
	<br>
	<br>
	<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
		<img alt="Configuration" src="images/03Configuration.png"><br>
	</div>
	<br>
	<br>
	<p>"Restore Defaults" sets the values of the variables visible in
		this tab back to their defaults, if they have any. This is different
		from the "Revert" button on the lower right, which reverts to the
		previously saved changes. All changes should be saved using the
		"Apply" button next to it.</p>
	<h3 style="text-align: left;">
		<a name="AdvancedTab"></a>Advanced Settings
	</h3>
	<p>The Advanced Tab exposes for configuration all the attributes
		for job submission as defined in the XML. The viewer allows you to
		select the ones that are applicable (only these will appear in the
		configuration). The text box above the table/tree containing the
		attribute list also displays a string of name=value defintions from
		the table (here for viewing convenience only). The table has typed
		values; it provides an appropriate editor (drop-down list, numerical
		spinner, checkbox, etc.) to fill in the value according to the value's
		type; doing "tab" after filling in the value effects the change. The
		check box at the top left "Show Only Checked Items" allows you to
		filter out unchecked items from the table list.</p>
	<br>
	<br>
	<div style="margin-left: 40px;">

	</div>
	<br>
	<br>
	<h3 style="text-align: left;">
		<a name="ImportTab"></a>Importing a Predefined Batch Script
	</h3>
	<p>If you wish to use a custom script that does more than just
		launch the application selected from your local or remote workspace,
		this tab is where you do it. The "Browse" button at the top
		right takes you first to your current workspace, in case you have
		imported a batch script there from either your local machine or a
		remote host; however, you can usually navigate from there to other
		directories in your local file system to search for a script.</p>
	<p>The path of the selected script is displayed in the textbox to
		the left of the browse button, and the contents of the script in the
		large (scrolling) text area below. The script is not editable there;
		to edit, you will need to import it like any other file into your
		workspace. The selection can be cleared or cancelled using the "Clear"
		button.</p>
	<p>The PBS import tab is preconfigured with an optional table
		viewer for selecting the variables from the environment which you wish
		to pass to the launch command along with the script.</p>
	<p>
		<b>NOTE:</b>
	<ol>
		<li><b>The values should correspond to whatever the script is
				giving to PBS; if the current values in the environment do not
				match, they can be changed here. However, these are set <i>for
					the benefit of the internal consistency of the PTP client, and do
					not override those hard-coded in script.</i> </b></li>
		<li>Unselecting the variable means that its value will not be
			passed to the resource manager.</li>
		<li>If the error and output paths are not selected or blank, the
			default locations will be accessed by the monitor; these, however,
			require the Job_Name property to be set (and be correct; see further
			the following paragraph).</li>
		<li>Setting the destination is for the benefit of monitoring
			consistency.</li>
	</ol>
	<br>

	<br>
	<br>
	<h4 style="text-align: left;">
		<a name="OutputFiles"></a>Reading remote output and error files
	</h4>

	<p>The JAXB/PBS manager has the capability of allowing you to
		stream in to the console the output and error files associated with a
		batch job when the job has completed. This is done in the XML
		definition file for the Basic and Advanced tabs by creating a link
		from the PBS batch attributes defining Output Path and Error Path to
		special (hidden) variables understood by the resource manager. If you
		set the PBS attributes, the change will be conveyed through the linked
		variables. If they are not set, the configuration provides a value
		corresponding to the default location where PBS would put them.</p>
	<p>
		<b>NOTE: </b>If you are using the Import Script tab, the two paths
		must be manually adjusted to correspond to whatever you have done
		inside the script; the default definitions are provided, but these can
		be adjusted as necessary.
	</p>

	<p>If there are files associated with this job, and the job
		completes, the "Get Job Error" and "Get Job Output" actions, activated
		by clicking the row associated with the job in the monitor job table,
		can be used to issue a streaming command which will write the file
		contents to the console. If the files do not exist, these actions will
		be disabled.</p>
	<br>
	<br>
	<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
		<img alt="Actions" src="images/08Actions.png"><br>
	</div>
	<br>
	<br>
	<h2 style="text-align: left;">
		<a name="InteractiveSubmission"></a>Submission Using the PBS
		Interactive Resource Manager
	</h2>
	<p>The Interactive Resource Manager allows you to submit jobs
		through a pseudo-terminal. This is done by issuing "qsub -I" (plus any
		resource limits defined in the tab) upon the first launch, and waiting
		for the interactive job to start. When the job turns from SUBMITTED to
		RUNNING (this can be seen both from the reported state in monitor job
		table views, as well as by the disappearance of the progress bars for
		the submission), the job will then be streamed to the qsub terminal's
		standard input, just as it would when you submit from a shell
		command-line. Subsequent submissions will also be streamed to the same
		interactive terminal process, for as long as it is running. If the
		time limit expires, the next submission will resubmit the terminal
		request (qsub -I).</p>
	<p>
		<b>The Launch Tab for this kind of job closely resembles the Basic
			batch tab.</b>
	</p>
	<br>
	<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
		<img alt="Imported" src="images/07Interactive.png"><br>
	</div>
	<br>
	<p>The job output will go to the console when the job starts to
		run, as seen here.</p>
	<br>
	<br>
	<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
		<img alt="Output" src="images/09Output.png"><br>
	</div>
	<br>
	<br>
	<h2 style="text-align: left;">
		<a name="Preferences"></a>Preferences
	</h2>
	<p>The preference options are mainly aids for the developer or user
		who wishes to reconfigure or modify the resource manager
		configuration. Since the PBS Resource Manager is configured from an
		XML definition file, the file can be cached the first time you add the
		resource manager (this is the default behavior), or you can set it to
		reread the file every time you start the Resource Manager. This is
		useful if you are doing customization (see below) and are configuring
		from a special XML file you have imported into your workspace. This
		way, if you make changes, they will automatically be picked up without
		having to reboot the application or recreate the Resource Manager.
	<p>
		<br>
	<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
		<img alt="Preferences" src="images/00Preferences.png"><br>
	</div>
	<br>
	<ol>
		<li>From the "Eclipse" menu, select "Preferences"</li>
		<li>Open Parallel Tools / Resource Managers / Configurable
			Resource Manager (JAXB)</li>
		<li>Select "Always reload XML from URL" and click "Apply", then
			"OK".</li>
	</ol>
	<p>The other options are useful if you are writing a new stream
		tokenizer for a command (which can be tricky); checking all four
		options usually produces quite a bit of output, so in that case it may
		be advisable to log the results to a file rather than stdout (at any
		rate the latter would be available only if PTP were running as an
		application within the Eclipse IDE platform, which is not the case for
		those modifying the XML simply from within the PTP package
		installation workspace).</p>

	<h2 style="text-align: left;">
		<a name="Customizing"></a>Customizing the Configuration
	</h2>
	<p>The Resource Manager configuration for PBS can be customized to
		suit the needs of the systems you habitually work with. Of course, an
		understanding of the basic structure and content of the XML definition
		is necessary for this, but often it may simply be a question of
		changing a few of the provided attribute defaults or definitions or a
		special command definition.</p>
	<p>The way to provide a specialized XML configuration is by placing
		it in a project named "resourceManagers" in your current workspace.
		You can import an XML file into your workspace in three different
		ways:</p>
	<br>
	<ul>
		<li><b>Using Import :: General :: File System</b> for files on
			your local machine;<br>
		</li>
		<li><b>Using Import :: Remote Systems :: Remote file system</b>
			for files on a remote machine;</li>
		<li><b>Using Import :: Resource Managers :: Resource Manager
				Definition from Plug-in</b> for the predefined definitions provided with
			the PTP distribution.<br>
		</li>
	</ul>
	<br>

	<p>In the first two cases, you must have created the
		"resourceManagers" project first; the third wizard asks you if you
		wish to create one if one does not already exist. The following
		illustrates the last kind of import.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Open up your Remote C/C++ perspective containing your
			workspace</li>
		<li>Right click in the Project Explorer and then select "Import
			:: Import..."</li>
	</ul>
	<br>
	<br>
	<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
		<img alt="Output1" src="images/10Import.png"><br>
	</div>
	<br>
	<br>
	<ul>
		<li>Choose Resource Managers :: Resource Manager Definition from
			Plug-in</li>
	</ul>
	<br>
	<br>
	<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
		<img alt="Output2" src="images/11Import.png"><br>
	</div>
	<br>
	<br>
	<ul>
		<li>Select one of the configurations from the drop-down list, and
			click "Finish".</li>
	</ul>
	<br>
	<br>
	<div style="margin-left: 40px;">
		<img alt="Output3" src="images/12Import.png"><br>
	</div>
	<br>
	<br>
	<p>The XML file will now appear in the "resourceManagers" directory;
		double-clicking on it will open an editor in your workspace. The XML
		editor which has been included in the PTP all-in-one download
		("Eclipse for Parallel Application Developers") does syntax
		highlighting and also provides a design tree-view for examining its
		structure.</p>
	<br>
	<br>
