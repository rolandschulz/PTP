This package contains the source code of the SLURM proxy server. The following
steps are used to set up your build environment so that the executable will be
correctly built and installed. In order to use the server binary, it needs to 
be installed in a fragment that corresponds to the architecture of the machine 
it will be run on. 


1. Build the corresponding "proxy" and "utils" libraries in $PTPDIR/core/org.eclipse.ptp.proxy 
   and $PTPDIR/core/org.eclipse.ptp.utils directory using 'configure', 'make' and 'make install'.


2. Use'configure', 'make' and 'make install' within this directory 
   to build and install the executable.
   NOTE: The 'configure' command MUST require '--with-slurm' option to specify the
   top install directory of SLURM. If such option is missed, the configure process will fail.
   
   If necessary, use 'aclocal', 'autoreconf --install', 'automake', 'autoconf' to generate
   all necessray files.


3. If any of the automake/autoconf files changes,  
   run 'autoreconf' to regenerate appropriate files.
