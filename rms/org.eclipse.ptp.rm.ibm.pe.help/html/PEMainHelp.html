<h1>Running IBM Parallel Environment Applications</h1>
<h2><A name=introduction></A>Introduction</h2>
<p>The IBM Parallel Environment (PE) Eclipse plug-in, part of the 
<a href="PLUGINS_ROOT/org.eclipse.ptp.doc.user/html/toc.html">Parallel Tools Platform</a> (PTP),  
allows you to run a parallel application using IBM Parallel Environment from within the PTP framework. 
In addition to running applications, you can monitor their status, control their execution, and view their stdio
output from within PTP. You can also debug a parallel application using the built in PTP parallel debugger.</p>
<p>You can run and debug parallel applications either as local projects or as remote projects, using the remote development 
environment support that is part of PTP.</p>
<p>Optionally, you can use IBM Tivoli WorkloadScheduler LoadLeveler to manage your application's access to system resources</p>
<p>This plugin consists of two parts. The first is the Eclipse PTP plugin code which is responsible for the PTP views 
presented to the user and the user's interaction with those views. The second part is a resource manager (proxy), which is
responsible for communicating with the PTP PE plugin code, invoking the parallel application, and reporting application
status to the PTP PE plugin.</p>

<!----------- caveat for PTP 6.0 ------------>
<p><b>Note:</b> PTP 6.0 does not require the creation of separate <i>Resource Managers</i>
and instead, the target configuration is specified on the Run Configuration dialog.

This document describes the legacy (proxy-based) Resource Managers supported in versions of PTP
prior to PTP 6.0.  Target System Configurations replace Resource Managers in PTP 6.0 and beyond.

<h2><A name=installation></A>Installation</h2>
If you will be running applications using PE with a host list and not using LoadLeveler to manage resource allocation,
then installation is complete once you complete the PTP plugin installation procedures. If you plan to use LoadLeveler 
to manage resource allocation, then you will need to rebuild the Parallel Environment proxy by following these steps
<ol>
<li>Make sure you have installed LoadLeveler and that the llapi.h include file exists on your system.
It normally is located in the ./full/include directory within a LoadLeveler installation. 
LoadLeveler is normally installed in /usr/lpp/LoadL on AIX systems and in /opt/ibmll/LoadL on Linux systems. LoadLeveler may also be 
installed in a private directory if you choose to do so.
<li>cd to the org.eclipse.ptp.ibmpe.proxy directory inside your plugins directory.</li>
<li>Invoke the configure script in that directory with the <b>--with-ll-header</b> flag, specifying the path to
the directory containing llapi.h. (Use <b>configure --help</b> to see a complete list of configure script options)</li>
<li>Invoke <b>make</b> in the same directory.
</ol>
<h2><A name=starting></A>Getting Started</h2>
<p>Define an appropriate project, either a C/C++ project using CDT, or a Fortran project using Photran. You can define 
either a standard make project or a managed make project.</p>
<p>When you define the project, you should specify the project location as a directory which is shared among all nodes 
where the parallel application will run to ensure Parallel Environment has access to the executable on all nodes. The 
following image shows how a project can be created using a directory visible to all nodes.</p>
<img src="images/project_create_1.jpg"> 
<p>You should use the following compiler invocation commands
to invoke the compiler, either in your makefile, or when specifying the compiler and linker in a managed make project.</p>
<ul>
<li>AIX</li>
<ul>
<li>mpcc_r for C programs</li>
<li>mpCC_r for C++ programs</li>
<li>mpxlf_r for Fortran programs</li>
</ul>
<li>Linux</li>
<ul>
<li>mpcc for C programs</li>
<li>mpCC for C++ programs</li>
<li>mpfort for Fortran programs</li>
</ul>
</ul> 
<p>The following image shows how the compiler is specified for a managed make project. The correct linker should also
be specified by clicking the settings for the linker.</p>
<img src="images/project_create_2.jpg">
<p>Once you have created your project, you should switch to the PTP runtime perspective, and set up the default 
preferences for Parallel Environment and specify the required resource manager. This setup needs to only be done once.</p>
<p>You specify the default preferences by opening the preferences dialog, opening the <b>PTP</b> node, opening the
<b>Resource Managers</b> node, and then clicking the <b>Parallel Environment</b> entry. The PE preferences panel is displayed. Here,
you specify the default settings for a resource manager to be used for Parallel Environment.</p>
<img src="images/pe_preferences.jpg">
<p>The settings that can be specified here are:</p>
<ul>
<li>The pathname to the PE proxy executable. This proxy handles the interaction between the Eclipse PTP session and your 
parallel applications.</li>
<li>Multiplexing options</li>
<li>Whether the proxy is started manually or is started automatically when Eclipse is started</li>
<li>Whether LoadLeveler is used to manage access to system resources</li>
<li>If LoadLeveler is used:</li>
<ul>
<li>Whether PTP forces LoadLeveler to operate in multi-cluster mode, single (local) cluster mode, or to use the mode 
LoadLeveler was configured for</li>
<li>The minimum interval that the proxy will poll LoadLeveler to query node status</li>
<li>The maximum interval that the proxy will poll LoadLeveler to query node status</li>
<li>The interval that the proxy will poll LoadLeveler for job status</li>
<li>Alternate directory for the LoadLaveler interface library. This option is useful if LoadLeveler is not installed
on the node where the proxy runs, and you have installed your own copy of the LoadLeveler interface library libllapi</li>
<li>Whether a second proxy process is started when the PTP PE proxy shuts down. This second proxy is useful in cases where
an application writes data to STDIO. If the PE PTP proxy shuts down without starting the second proxy, then the application
may suspend since there is no process intercepting the STDIO output from the application. If this option is selected,
a second, smaller, proxy is started. This second proxy intercepts the STDIO output from the application and writes it to
files in /tmp. This prevents the application from blocking when the pipes connected to the application's STDIO
file descriptors are full.</li>
<li>Specify the level of tracing performed by the proxy. This option is useful when attempting to diagnose problems
with the PTP PE plugin</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you have set up preferences, create the resource manager for Parallel Environment. To do this, right-click in the
resource managers view and select <b>Add Resource Manager</b> from the menu. A resource manager wizard will be 
displayed. Select <b>PE</b> from the list of resource manager types and click next.</p> 
<p>The next panel displayed is the first wizard panel which configures the PE resource manager.</p>
<img src="images/pe_proxy_config_1.jpg">
<p>This panel is the standard PTP wizard resource manager configuration wizard panel which specifies the location and
connection attributes for a proxy.</p>
<p>Select the Remote service provider and proxy server location from the dropdown lists. You can
also create a new proxy server location by clicking the <b>New</b> button in this pane. Specify the path to the proxy 
server executable, or just accept the value filled in as default from the preferences panel. Uncheck the <b>Launch server 
manually</b> and click next again to proceed to the next wizard panel</p> 
<img src="images/pe_proxy_config_2.jpg">
<p>This panel is used to specify the proxy options for this particular resource manager configuration. Most of the
options on this panel are identical with the corresponding option in the PE plugin preferences panel.
This panel has one additional option, which specifies whether the proxy execution is to be suspended immediately after 
it starts. This option is intended to be used in debugging the proxy in cases where it is necessary to suspend proxy 
execution before the first command sent to the proxy is processed, so that a debugger can be attached to the proxy process</p>
<p>Once the fields on this panel have been filled in, click next to proceed to the next wizard panel</p>
<p>On the final page of the resource configuration manager wizard, either accept the 
default resource manager name, or uncheck the checkbox and enter a name and description for the resource manager. 
Then click finish to create the resource manager entry.</p>
<p>You may have as many resource managers defined as you require for your system configuration.</p>
<p>Once you have defined a resource manager, you must start it before it can run a parallel application using that
resource manager. To start a resource manager, right-click over the name of the resource manager in the resource manager 
view then select <b>Start resource manager</b> from the popup menu. Once started, the icon for the selected resource 
manager will turn green.</p> 
<p>If necessary, you can stop a resource manager by right-clicking over its name in the resource manager and selecting 
<b>Stop resource manager</b> from the popup menu. Normally, a resource manger will shutdown automatically when PTP is
shutdown, and if it was running when PTP was shutdown, then it will automatically start when PTP is started again.</p>
<p>You can edit resource manager configuration for a resource manager that is in the stopped state by double clicking
the resource manager name or by right clicking the resource manager name and selecting <b>Edit Resource Manager</b> 
from the drop down menu.</p>
<h2><A name=running></A>Running a Parallel Application</h2>
<p>Once an application has been compiled, the first step in running the application is to be sure the resource manager for 
Parallel Environment is running on the node where you intend to start the application. To do this, check the resource 
manager's entry in the resource manager view. The icon for the resource manager should be green. If it is not green, then 
right click over the resource manager's name and select <b>Start resource manager</b> from the popup menu to start the
resource manager.</p>
<p>Before running an application, it must have a launch configuration defined for it. A launch configuration contains 
all of the settings required to run the application. The values entered in a launch configuration are saved so that the
next time the application is run using the same launch configuration, those values do not need to be entered again.</p>
<p>To create a launch configuration, click the <b>Run</b> menu in the Eclipse menubar and select <b>Open Run Dialog</b>. 
Alternatively, click the dropdown next to the run icon in the Eclipse toolbar and select Open Run Dialog. 
When the run dialog is displayed, right click over <b>Parallel Application</b> and click <b>New</b> from the menu. 
This will create a new launch configuration. Set its name to the desired value. Select the <b>Main</b> tab and fill in
the name of the project and the application program. Make sure that the debugger tab has an appropriate debugger selected.
Fill in the Arguments tab with any application program arguments. Fill in the Environment tab with any environment variable
settings required by the application. If you are using Parallel Environment in basic mode, described below, then you should
not set any Parallel Environment environment variables (starting with MP_) in the Environment tab and not specify any
options specific to the <b>poe</b> command in the Arguments tab, since those settings may conflict with settings in the
Parallel tab and cause application invocation to fail.</p>
<p>The <b>Resources</b> tab is the tab where invocation options unique to Parallel Environment are specified. When it is initially displayed,
it will appear as follows.</p>
<img src="images/pe_run_config.jpg">
<p>The first step is to select a resource manager from the dropdown list at the top of the resources tab. This list contains
entries for each running resource manager. </p>
<p>The next step is to select the run mode for the resource manager by checking or unchecking the <b>Advanced Mode</b>
checkbox.</p>
<p>When this checkbox is checked, the resource manager is running in advanced mode. In this mode, you need to have an existing
setup script created. This is a text file, similar to a .rc or .profile script, where you specify Parallel Environment
environment variable settings. Each setting is specified as a keyword-value pair such as</p>
<samp>
MP_PROCS=2<br>
MP_HOSTFILE=/home/deepview/hostfile
</samp>
<p>This file should contain only Parallel Environment environment variable settings. Anything else is ignored. 
Environment variable settings in this file are not validity checked. You may also specify Parallel Environment environment 
variables in the Environment tab in this mode, as well as specifying parameters to the <b>poe</b> command in the Arguments
tab in advanced mode. Any settings in these tabs will not be checked, and may result in conflicts with what is specified
in the setup script.</p>
<p>When using advanced mode, the <b>Environment Setup Script</b> will be enabled, and you must fill in the pathname to the 
setup script.</p>
<p>If the <b>Advanced Mode</b> checkbox is not checked, then the resource manager is running in basic mode. In this mode,
the tabbed pane at the bottom of the Parallel tab will be enabled, and you can fill in the required values for running 
your application.</p>
<p>In basic mode, each Parallel Environment option has a field in the tabbed pane at the bottom of the parallel tab. 
Each field has flyover help, where you can see that help by moving the mouse over the field in question. Each field is 
validity checked where possible to reduce the probability of invoking an application with invalid parameters.</p>
<p>If any value in the parallel tab is invalid, an error message will appear in the upper left corner of the launch
configuration dialog and the apply and run buttons will be disabled. Once all fields have valid values, then you can
click the <b>Apply</b>button to save the current settings for the launch configuration, or click the <b>Run</b> button to
invoke the application.</p>
<p>As a minimum, the launch configuration or the Parallel Environment setup script must specify the path name of a valid 
hostfile (MP_HOSTFILE) and number of parallel tasks (MP_TASKS)<p>
<h3><a name=debugging></a>Debugging a Parallel Application</h3>
You can debug a parallel application using the built in PTP parallel debugger. You can do this using the same run configuration 
that you use for running your application. You can debug the application by clicking the debug icon 
in the Eclipse toolbar or by selecting <b>Debug Configurations</b> from the Eclipse run menu. Before you debug a parallel application 
for the first time, you should make sure that you have properly configured the debugger by opening
the run configuration and selecting the debug tab then making sure the debugger settings are correct.</p>  
<h2><a name=redirection></a>Redirecting stdio</h2>
<p>The default behavior is that data the application writes to stdout is sent to the PTP GUI. That data can be viewed by 
double clicking the task icon for the task, normally task 0, in the jobs view row for the application. This will open
a process view window showing the data. By default, the application stderr output is written to the console where Eclipse 
was invoked.</p>
<p>If the application writes a large amount of data to stdout or stderr, the default behavior of sending that data to the
PTP GUI for handling can cause the GUI to become slow or unresponsive. Alternatively, stdout and stderr can be redirected to
files on the node where the resource manager process is running. This is done by specifying the path name for stdout or
stderr in the fields labelled <b>Stdout Path</b> or <b>Stderr Path</b> in the parallel tab of the launch configuration.</p>

<h2><a name=monitoring></a>Monitoring Application Execution</h2>
<p>Once you click run to invoke the application, the resource manager will monitor the application's execution. When Parallel
Environment allocates tasks to nodes, the default machine view for the resource manager will be updated to show the nodes 
that are currently in use. If you move the mouse over a node icon, in the machine view, you will see the hostname for that node. 
If you double click a node icon in the machine view, the node attributes and process info windows in the machine view
will be updated to report current status for that node. Once a job completes, the machines view will be updated to 
show the current status. As applications complete, nodes may disappear from the machine view if no other parallel tasks
invoked by you are using those nodes.</p>
<p>Once a parallel application starts, the jobs view will be updated to show an entry for that job, along with icons for each
task in the application. The job and task icons will change state once Parallel Environment setup is complete to show the
job is running, and again when the application exits, to show that the job has completed. At any time that a job is shown in
the jobs view, you can double click a task icon to show the stdout output for that task if stdout has not been
redirected to a file.</p>
<h2><A name=restrictions></A>Restrictions</h2>
<ul>
<li>Applications cannot read input from stdin at this time</li>
<li>Debugging applications is not supported at this time</li>
<li>All pathnames specified in the Parallel tab of the launch configuration must be absolute pathnames</li>
<li>When using LoadLeveler, you can only viw stdout and stderr output for applications started by you using this plugin. 
You cannot view output from other applications even though you can see their process icons in the PTP jobs view.</li> 
</ul>
