This project contains the source code of the ORTE proxy server. The following
steps are used to set up your build environment so that the executable will be
correctly built and installed. In order to use the server binary, it needs to 
be installed in a fragment that corresponds to the architecture of the machine 
it will be run on. 

1. Make sure you have checked out the fragment corresponding to your architecture. 
   For example, if you're on a Linux x86 machine, you should have the fragment:

		org.eclipse.ptp.orte.linux.x86

2. Run this following command to configure the project and set the prefix to
   the appropriate fragment directory:
   
   		sh SETUP

3. You are now able to use 'make' and 'make install', either from
   the command line, or from the 'Make Targets' view in Eclipse to 
   build and install the executable into the fragment directory.

4. If any of the automake/autoconf files changes, you should just need to
   run 'make' and it will automatically regenerate the appropriate files.
