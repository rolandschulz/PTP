<h1>SLURM Resource Manager for PTP</h1>
<h2><A name=introduction></A>Introduction</h2>
<p>The SLURM Eclipse plug-in, part of the 
<a href="PLUGINS_ROOT/org.eclipse.ptp.doc.user/html/toc.html">Parallel Tools Platform</a> (PTP),  
allows you to run a parallel application using the Simple Linux Utility for Resource Management (SLURM) from within the PTP framework.
In addition to running applications, you can monitor their status, control their execution, and view their stdio
output from within PTP. You can also debug a parallel application using the built in PTP parallel debugger. </p>
<p>You can run and debug parallel applications either as local projects or as remote projects, using the remote development 
environment support that is part of PTP.</p>

<p><b>Note:</b> this document describes the older legacy version of PTP launching,
which includes a <i>resource manager.</i>  The current release of PTP (7.0, June 2013)
no longer supports this.  
<!----------- caveat for PTP 6.0 and later ------------>

This document describes the legacy (proxy-based) Resource Managers supported in versions of PTP
prior to PTP 6.0.  Target System Configurations replace Resource Managers in PTP 6.0 and beyond.
The current release of PTP (7.0, June 2013)
no longer supports resource managers.

<!--  ------------------------------------- -->

<p>This plugin consists of two parts. The first is the Eclipse PTP plugin code which is responsible for the PTP views 
presented to the user and the user's interaction with those views. The second part is a resource manager (proxy), which is
responsible for communicating with the PTP SLURM plugin code, invoking the parallel application, and reporting application
status to the PTP SLURM plugin.</p>
