<h1>SLURM Resource Manager for PTP</h1>
<h2><a name=install></a>Installation</h2>
<p>To use the SLURM resource manager to manage resource allocation and to launch parallel jobs, 
you will need to build the SLURM proxy by following these steps after completing the PTP plugin installation procedures.</p>
<ol>
<li>Make sure you have installed SLURM and that the slurm.h and slurm_errno.h include files exist on your system.
They normally are located in the <b>include/slurm</b> directory within a SLURM installation. 
The location where SLURM is installed is up to you or your system administrator.</li>
<li>Make sure you have built PTP proxy and utils libraries successfully.  
If not, cd to the org.eclipse.ptp.proxy/utils directory inside your plugins directory, 
and run <b>configure</b> with default options, and then run <b>make</b> to build the necessary libraries.</li>
<li>cd to the org.eclipse.ptp.rm.slurm.proxy directory inside your plugins directory.</li>
<li>Invoke the configure script in that directory with the <b>--with-slurm=xxx</b> flag, specifying the path to
the include directory containing slurm/slurm.h (Use <b>configure --help</b> to see a complete list of configure script options)</li>
<li>Invoke <b>make</b> in the same directory. And if Makefile is not present, run <b>automake, autoconf</b> before invoking configure and make commands.
Once the build process completes successfully, an executable named "ptp_slurm_proxy" should be available under org.eclipse.ptp.rm.slurm.proxy directory.
</ol>
