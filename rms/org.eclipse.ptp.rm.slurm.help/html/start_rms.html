<h1>SLURM Resource Manager for PTP</h1>
<h2><A name=startemanager></A>Starting a Resource Manager</h2>
<p>Once you have defined a resource manager, you must start it before it can run a parallel application using that
resource manager. To start a resource manager, right-click over the name of the resource manager in the resource manager 
view then select <b>Start resource manager</b> from the popup menu. Once started, the icon for the selected resource 
manager will turn green.</p> 
<p>If necessary, you can stop a resource manager by right-clicking over its name in the resource manager and selecting 
<b>Stop resource manager</b> from the popup menu. Normally, a resource manger will shutdown automatically when PTP is
shutdown, and if it was running when PTP was shutdown, then it will automatically start when PTP is started again.</p>
