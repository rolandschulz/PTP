<h1>SLURM Resource Manager for PTP</h1>
<h2><a name=monitoring></a>Monitoring Application Execution</h2>

<p>Once you click run to invoke the application, the resource manager will monitor the application's execution. 
When SLURM allocates tasks to nodes, the default machine view for the resource manager will be updated to show the nodes 
that are currently in use. If you move the mouse over a node icon, in the machine view, you will see the hostname for that node. 
If you double click a node icon in the machine view, the node attributes and process info windows in the machine view
will be updated to report current status for that node. Once a job completes, the machines view will be updated to 
show the current status. Nodes state in the machines view are updated periodically by slurm proxy. </p>

<p>Once a parallel application starts, the jobs view will be updated to show an entry for that job, along with icons for each
task in the application. The job and task icons will change state once the
job is running, and again when the application exits, to show that the job has completed. At any time that a job is shown in
the jobs view, you can double click a task icon to show the stdout output for that task if stdout has not been
redirected to a file.</p>
