<h1>SLURM Resource Manager for PTP</h1>
<h2><A name=createmanager></A>Creating a Resource Manager</h2>
<p>Before launching a paralle job, you should create the resource manager for SLURM. To do this, right-click in the
resource managers view and selecting <b>Add Resource Manager</b> from the menu. A resource manager wizard will be 
displayed. Select <b>SLURM</b> from the list of resource manager types and click next. The next panel displayed configures
the SLURM resource manager. Select the Remote service provider and proxy server location from the dropdown lists. You can
also create a new proxy server location by clicking the <b>New</b> button in this pane. Specify the path to the proxy 
server executable, or just accept the value filled in as default from the preferences panel. 
In case of remote development, you should specify the <b>ip address</b> of the local machine (instead of localhost),
to which the remote slurm proxy will connect.
Uncheck the <b>Launch server 
manually</b> and click next again. On the final page of the resource configuration manager wizard, either accept the 
default resource manager name, or uncheck the checkbox and enter a name and description for the resource manager. 
Then click finish to create the resource manager entry.</p>
