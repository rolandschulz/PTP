	<h1>The PTP Configurable Resource Manager</h1>
	<h2>
		<a name="Introduction">Introduction</a>
	</h2>
	<p>
		The JAXB Eclipse plug-ins, part of the <a
			href="../../org.eclipse.ptp.help/html/PLUGINS_ROOT/org.eclipse.ptp.help/html/toc.html">
			Parallel Tools Platform</a> (PTP), allow you to launch and monitor
		applications on local or remote resources using resource managers
		which are configured from an XML file via JAXB (
		<code>javax.xml.bind</code>
		) technology.<br>
	</p>
	<p>
		JAXB resource managers consist of two components, a "control" and a
		"monitor". In most cases, the monitor will be a pre-built type
		provided by the PTP distribution, either a standard interactive
		monitor or the batch-system monitor implemented using <a
			href="http://www2.fz-juelich.de/jsc/llview">LLView</a>. Adding a new
		resource manager type will thus normally entail only the specific
		configuration of its control part.
	</p>
	<h2>
		<a name="Requirements">Requirements</a>
	</h2>
	<p>In addition to having Eclipse and PTP installed, you need to
		have the following software dependencies installed.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>CDT for Indigo, available from the Eclipse download site or
			as part of the pre-built PTP package;</li>
		<li>RSE for Indigo, available from the Eclipse download site or
			as part of the pre-built PTP package.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>If the monitor of any JAXB resource manager uses LLView, an
		LLView server must be set up separately or an installation must be
		available to point the client monitoring component to.</p>
	<p>
		<b>There are two main sections to the help pages which follow. The
			first concerns creating or modifying a resource manager
			configuration; the second are some general guidelines for using the
			JAXB resource managers. For those interested only in using the JAXB
			resource managers already provided with the PTP distribution, the
			first section may be skipped.</b></p>
