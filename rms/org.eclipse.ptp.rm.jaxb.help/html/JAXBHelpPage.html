	<h1>The PTP Configurable Resource Manager</h1>
	<h2>
		<a name="Introduction">Introduction</a>
	</h2>
	<p>
		The JAXB Resource Manager plug-ins, part of the <a
			href="../../org.eclipse.ptp.help/html/PLUGINS_ROOT/org.eclipse.ptp.help/html/toc.html">
			Parallel Tools Platform</a> (PTP), allow you to launch and monitor
		applications on local or remote resources using resource managers
		which are configured from an XML file via JAXB (
		<code>javax.xml.bind</code>
		) technology.<br>
	</p>
	<p>There are two main motivations for providing this class of
		resource managers:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>To allow for maximum configurability. Often job schedulers
			(PBS, LSF, LoadLeveler, etc.) or interactive runtime systms (OpenMPI,
			PE, SLURM, etc.) are set up by system administrators in special or
			non-standard ways which make it difficult to use a generic tool. The
			configuration file allows a user or community of users to fit the
			resource manager to a class of systems or even to a single host.</li>
		<li>Building the resource manager and its UI presentation from an
			XML configuration means that in most cases no special coding is
			necessary. Users should be able to accommodate new systems, at least
			on the client-end, without writing and loading additional Eclipse
			plugins. (The only qualification here is that the monitoring
			component also support that type of scheduler or runtime; see the
			following paragraphs.)</li>
	</ol>
	<p>An additional consideration in designing a generically
		configurable resource manager was to partition the client
		functionality so as to eliminate the need for special server-side
		proxies and to scale more successfully in the updating of job and
		resource information.</p>
	<p>
		To this end, JAXB resource managers now consist of two components, a
		"control", which governs the configuration, launch and cancellation of
		individual jobs entirely from the client end, and a "monitor", which
		displays job status as well as global information about the HPC
		resource. In most cases, the monitor will be a pre-built type provided
		by the PTP distribution, either a generic class for handling
		interactive submissions, or a batch-system monitor implemented using <a
			href="http://www2.fz-juelich.de/jsc/llview">LLView</a>. Since <b>LLView</b>
		already supports a good number of the standard scheduler types, adding
		a new resource manager type will normally entail only the specific
		configuration of its control part. We plan to make available both
		user-initiated as well as system-wide deployment of the necessary
		LLView parts (mostly Perl scripts) for monitoring the target resource.
	</p>
	<h2>
		<a name="Requirements">Requirements</a>
	</h2>
	<p>In addition to having Eclipse and PTP installed, you need to
		have the following software dependencies installed.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>CDT for Indigo, available from the Eclipse download site or
			as part of the pre-built PTP package;</li>
		<li>RSE for Indigo, available from the Eclipse download site or
			as part of the pre-built PTP package.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>If the monitor of any JAXB resource manager uses LLView, an
		LLView server must be set up separately or an installation must be
		available to point the client monitoring component to.</p>
	<p>
		<b>There are two main sections to the help pages which follow. The
			first concerns creating or modifying a resource manager
			configuration; the second are some general guidelines for using the
			JAXB resource managers. For those interested only in using the JAXB
			resource managers already provided with the PTP distribution, the
			first section may be skipped.</b>
