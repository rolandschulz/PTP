	<h1>The JAXB Configurable Resource Manager</h1>

	<h3>
		<a name="PTP501">PTP 5.0.1 Changes</a>
	</h3>

	<p>Aside from some significant bug fixes, there are a number of new
		features with the 5.0.1 release.</p>
	<ol>
		<li>The <code>widget</code> component has been split up into
			three components: <a href="#Widget"><code>widget</code> </a>, <a
			href="#ButtonGroup"><code>button-group</code> </a>, and <a
			href="#Browse"><code>browse</code> </a>;</li>
		<li><a href="#Action"><code>action</code> </a> push-button
			functionality has been added;</li>
		<li><a href="#ControlState"><code>control-state</code> </a>
			elements have been added to all UI control descriptors;</li>
		<li>The launch tab <a href="#LaunchTab"><code>import</code> </a>
			controller type has been modified (largely for maintaining unformity
			of implementation) to subclass the <code>dynamic</code> controller;</li>
		<li>Ability to inspect invisible discovered (excluded) properties
			and attributes via a "View" button (see <a href="#TabController">note</a>)
			has been added;</li>
		<li><a href="#Preferences">Preferences</a> have been added to
			help with thue debugging of <a href="#StreamParsers">stream
				tokenizers</a>;</li>
		<li>Resource Manager "environment" handling has been totally
			rewritten in order to support the exclusion of properties associated
			with invisible or disabled widgets, and to allow for the restoration
			of their values when re-enabled.</li>
	</ol>

	<p>In addition, some tweaking of the SWT "knobs" was necessary to
		get the XML to reflect more closely the behavior of the Java classes
		(especially in terms of defaults).</p>
	<hr>

	<h2>
		<a name="Introduction">Introduction</a>
	</h2>

	<p>
		The JAXB Resource Manager plug-ins allow you to launch and monitor
		applications on local or remote resources using resource managers
		which are configured from an XML file via JAXB (
		<code>javax.xml.bind</code>
		) technology.<br>
	</p>

	<p>There are two main motivations for providing this class of
		resource managers:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>To allow for maximum adaptability. Often job schedulers (PBS,
			LSF, LoadLeveler, etc.) or interactive runtime systems (OpenMPI, PE,
			SLURM, etc.) are set up by system administrators in special or
			non-standard ways which make it difficult to use a generic tool. The
			configuration file allows a user or community of users to fit the
			resource manager to a class of systems, to a single host, or even to
			special application usage.</li>
		<li>Building the resource manager and its UI presentation from an
			XML configuration means that in most cases no special Java coding is
			necessary. Users should be able to accommodate new systems, at least
			on the client-end, without writing and loading additional Eclipse
			plugins. (The only qualification here is that the monitoring
			component also support that type of scheduler or runtime; see the
			following paragraphs.)</li>
	</ol>

	<p>Additional considerations in designing a generically
		configurable resource manager were to partition the client
		functionality so as to eliminate the need for special server-side
		proxies and to scale more successfully in the updating of job and
		resource information.</p>

	<p>
		To this end, JAXB resource managers now consist of two components, a
		"control", which governs the configuration, launch and cancellation of
		individual jobs entirely from the client end, and a "monitor", which
		displays job status as well as global information about the HPC
		resource. In most cases, the monitor will be a pre-built type provided
		by the PTP distribution, implemented using <a
			href="http://www2.fz-juelich.de/jsc/llview">LLview</a>. Since <b>LLview</b>
		already supports a good number of the standard scheduler types, adding
		a new resource manager type will normally entail only the specific
		configuration of its control part. The default mode of usage is that
		the client stages the necessary LLview components (mostly Perl
		scripts) automatically, but in a future release, the monitor will also
		be capable of connecting directly to a system-wide (web-based)
		deployment.
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>The following is a guide to the resource manager XML
			definition. Those interested only in using the JAXB resource managers
			already provided with the PTP distribution should consult the User
			pages under the relevant scheduler (currently only the PBS resource
			managers are JAXB-configurable; please see the <a
			href="PLUGINS_ROOT/org.eclipse.ptp.rm.jaxb.pbs.doc.user/html/toc.html">PBS
				Res Mgr help</a>).</b>
	</p>
	<hr>
	<h2>
		<a name="Customizing"></a><a href="JAXBDemo.pdf">Configuring/Customizing
			the Resource Manager</a>
	</h2>

	<p>
		We provide here an introductory tutorial slide set demonstrating some
		simple additions to a pre-existing resource manager definition file.
		For some example XML illustrating various aspects of the schema
		(particularly UI features), we also provide a <a
			href="JAXBExamples_5.0.1.zip">.zip file (for PTP release 5.0.1)</a>.
	</p>

	<h3>
		<a name="Preferences"></a>Preferences
	</h3>

	<p>The preference options are aids for debugging configuration
		changes. The first has to do with altering the default behavior of the
		resource manager, which is to cache its XML definition file; this can
		be overridden to reread the file every time you start the Resource
		Manager. This way, if you make changes, they will automatically be
		picked up without having to reboot the application or recreate the
		Resource Manager.</p>

	<p>The other options are useful if you are writing a new stream
		tokenizer for a command; checking all four options usually produces
		quite a bit of output, so in that case it may be advisable to log the
		results to a file rather than stdout (at any rate the latter would be
		available only if PTP were running as an application within the
		Eclipse IDE platform, which is not the case for those modifying the
		XML simply from within the PTP package installation workspace).</p>

	<h2>
		<a name="XSD"></a><a href="resource_manager_type.xsd">The JAXB
			Configurable Resource Manager XML Schema</a><br>
	</h2>

	<p>
		The JAXB Resource Manager is <b><i>model-driven</i> </b>; this means
		that its functioning and appearance are determined by a set of
		definitions provided via an XML file. What follows is a detailed
		explanation of the schema governing the resource manager XML
		definition.
	</p>

	<h3>
		<a name="ResourceManagerData">The Resource Manager Data Type</a>
	</h3>

	<img alt="ResourceManagerData" src="images/01rm-data.jpeg" />

	<p>
		The top-level of the definition tree consists of three elements: <b>site-</b>,
		<b>control-</b> and <b>monitor-data</b>. In addition, a resource
		manager should be given a name which sufficiently distinguishes it
		from others of a similar type; e.g., <i>pbs-torque-v_2.3.7_abe</i> is
		specific to an installation on the host abe, <i>ll-v_4.0</i> suits all
		installations of LoadLeveler version 4, etc.
	</p>

	<p>
		The <b>site-data</b> element provides an optional place to set fixed
		or default remote site information. The connection strings are URIs
		which are specific to the PTP RemoteServices definitions. The scheme
		for these URIs will usually name the specific remote service (e.g,
		<code>rse:</code>
		or
		<code>remotetools:</code>
		; local is simply
		<code>file:</code>
		). The host name and port given here will appear as defaults in the
		resource manager selection wizard when you create a new connection.
	</p>

	<p>
		The principal section of the schema is devoted to defining the
		resource manager's <b>control</b> part. The top-level control elements
		include properties and attributes, files to be staged, job script to
		be generated (if any), commands specific to the resource manager, and
		the layout of the Launch Tab.
	</p>

	<h4>
		<a name="Environment">Resource Manager Environment</a>
	</h4>
	<p>
		The resource manager implementation constructs a variable map from the
		defined properties and attributes which serves as the resource manager
		"environment". Some elements directly reference these by name; a
		text/string representation of property or attribute fields can be
		obtained via the Eclipse variable resolver syntax, with the namespace
		prefix set to <i>ptp_rm</i>:
		<code>
			${ptp_rm:name#<i>fieldName</i>}
		</code>
		, e.g.,
		<code>${ptp_rm:queues#value}</code>
		(see further <a href="#PropertyAttributeType">below</a> on the
		specific fields for properties and attributes).
	</p>
	<p>
		All properties and attributes defined in the configuration are mapped.
		The following hard-coded properties are also added at runtime: <br>
		<br>
		<code>control.user.name</code>
		<br>
		<code>control.address</code>
		<br>
		<code>control.working.dir</code>
		<br>
		<code>executablePath</code>
		<br>
		<code>progArgs</code>
		<br>
		<code>directory</code>
		<br> <br> In addition, these properties may be linked (see <a
			href="#PropertyAttributeType">below</a>) to other attributes to
		furnish the resource manager with an implementation-independent
		variable for the queue and for any remote output files produced in
		connection with the job submission. <br> <br>
		<code>control.queue.name</code>
		<br>
		<code>stdout_remote_path</code>
		<br>
		<code>stderr_remote_path</code>
		<br>
	</p>

	<h4>
		<a name="CommandTypes">Resource Manager Command Types</a>
	</h4>
	<p>
		<i>Commands</i> are system calls, either to a local or remote OS,
		depending on the connection defined for the resource manager. The <b>start-up-</b>
		and <b>shut-down-command</b>s are arbitrary commands to be run
		(serially in order) when the resource manager is started or stopped.
		The <b>submit</b> commands are those used to launch jobs. Currently a
		configuration may have only a batch or an interactive mode. Thus it
		may have only two submission modes, a run and a debug, for the given
		type. In the future we may allow all four to coexist in a single
		configuration. <b>get-job-status</b> is a user-initiated (on-demand)
		request to refresh the status information for a submission. Normal
		(polled) updates, on the other hand, are the responsibility of the
		<code>monitor</code>
		component. The status command nevertheless needs to be implemented in
		most cases, as it will be called internally just after submission. The
		remaining "-job" commands are operations which can be executed on
		submitted jobs; with the exception of <i>terminate</i>, the rest of
		these have to do with schedulers (batch-systems) and do not apply to
		resource managers which connect to interactive runtime-systems such as
		OpenMPI or PE. <b>Note</b>: if the submission type is interactive, the
		<b>terminate-job</b> command usually does not need to be implemented,
		as the process termination will be handled internally. However, in
		some cases (such as PBS -I) which require the interactive job to run
		as a pseudo-terminal, one may need this command in order to force its
		termination externally. Finally, a <b>button-action</b> is an
		arbitrary command associated with a button exposed through the
		<code>Launch Tab</code>
		(see further <a href="#Action">below</a>).
	</p>

	<h3>
		<a name="ControlType">The Control Data Type</a>
	</h3>

	<img alt="ControlData" src="images/02control.jpeg" />

	<p>The majority of the XML definition is given over to the set-up
		of the resource manager control. One can think of this section as
		having four subdivisions:</p>

	<ol>
		<li>Configuration Variable Definitions (the <i>Environment</i>i)</li>
		<li>Files and Scripts</li>
		<li>External Commands and their Stream Parsers</li>
		<li>UI Configuration (Launch Tab)</li>
	</ol>

	<p>We will look at these each in turn.</p>

	<h4>
		<a name="PropertyAttributeType">1. Property and Attribute Types</a>
	</h4>
	<p>
		A property is any variable necessary for the functioning of the
		resource manager. Properties often (but not necessarily) are not
		visible. The value for properties can be any primitive type, or lists
		or maps of strings. If
		<code>stdout</code>
		and
		<code>stderr</code>
		from a scheduled job is to be delivered to the client, the properties
		<i>stdout_remote_path</i> and <i>stderr_remote_path</i> should be
		included in the resource manager property set. Simarly, the native
		designation for the selected queue, if used, should be linked to <i>control.queue.name</i>.
	</p>

	<p>The distinction between attribute and property is not hard and
		fast, but the intention is to provide a way of differentiating between
		external, system-determined variables (attributes) and variables only
		required by the PTP implementation itself. There are several other
		elements and fields on the attribute, e.g., for type-specific defaults
		(min/max, choice). Generally, if the variable is exposed to the user,
		who should also be provided with a description or instructions for
		use, then it should be defined as an attribute.</p>

	<img alt="Attribute" src="images/040attribute.jpeg" />

	<p>
		The <i>visible</i> attribute is a way of indicating to the resource
		manager that the user will not be directly changing the value of the
		property or attribute via the user interface. Certain widgets (such as
		the
		<code>attribute viewer</code>
		) check this to see if the property or attribute should be included
		automatically in its list.
	</p>

	<hr>
	<h5>BEST PRACTICE: VISIBLE vs INVISIBLE</h5>
	<p>
		Always mark properties or attributes which are the targets of <i>saveValueTo</i>
		(see <a href="#Widget">below</a>) as <i>visible</i>="true"; if this
		value is false, this variable will <i>always</i> be passed to the
		configuration/environment of the resource manager; selection/exclusion
		of sets of properties or attributes pertains only to those marked
		visible.
	</p>
	<hr>
	<p>
		<i>status</i> is an optional field for capturing the validity of the
		attribute at runtime or for a particular installation, if such
		information is made available by the system. The <i>readOnly</i>
		property can be defined here, but more often will be enforced directly
		on the widget which is connected to the property or attribute. <i>min</i>
		and <i>max</i> give the boundaries for integer values, usually
		represented by spinner widgets.
	</p>

	<p>
		<code>description</code>
		is meant to be a brief one-sentence definition; most of the time
		detailed information will go into the
		<code>tooltip</code>
		element.
		<code>choice</code>
		is a predetermined, fixed set of values to choose from; these are
		comma-delimited and will appear as the items of a combo-box.
		<code>items-from</code>
		instead links the combo items (choice) to another property or
		attribute value (whose type must be
		<code>java.util.Collection</code>
		).
	</p>

	<h4 align="center">
		<a name="PAValueLink"> Property and Attribute Values </a>
	</h4>

	<p>
		The untyped
		<code>value</code>
		element on properties and attributes is for internal use only; to give
		a predefined (primitive) value, use the
		<code>default</code>
		element along with the <i>type</i> attribute.
	</p>

	<p>
		<code>link-value-to</code>
		works as follows: the property or attribute gets its value from the
		property or attribute linked to, unless that property or attribute has
		an undefined (empty) value; in the latter case, any default defined on
		the present property or attribute will be used. This feature is
		primarily intended for defining dependent properties or attributes
		whose values are not directly modified by the user.
	</p>

	<p>Attributes also carry optional validators which allow you to
		enforce syntactic rules or file-system semantics on the value when the
		user enters text.</p>

	<img alt="Validator" src="images/041validator.jpeg" />

	<h4 align="center">
		<a name="Regex">Regex and File Match Types</a>
	</h4>

	<p>
		The validator makes use of the
		<code>regex</code>
		type (also used in the parser or tokenizer; see <a
			href="#StreamParsers">below</a>), along with a special
		<code>file-match</code>
		type. A regex can be used to match by setting the <i>expression</i>
		field; to split the segment into tokens on the basis of the
		expression, set the <i>split</i> field to true (this applies only to
		the
		<code>match</code>
		type discussed <a href="#MatchType">below</a>). The expression should
		follow the grammar in
		<code>java.util.regex</code>
		; the <i>flags</i> are those made available in the
		<code>java.util.regex.Pattern</code>
		class (consult the Javadoc for explanations):
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>CASE_INSENSITIVE</li>
		<li>MULTILINE</li>
		<li>DOTALL</li>
		<li>UNICODE_CASE</li>
		<li>CANON_EQ</li>
		<li>LITERAL</li>
		<li>COMMENTS</li>
		<li>UNIX_LINES</li>
	</ul>

	<p>These can be OR'd in the usual manner.</p>

	<p>
		<code>file-match</code>
		exports the attributes pertaining to
		<code>org.eclipse.core.filesystem.IFileInfo</code>
		; <i>efsAttributes</i> is an OR'd string of the EFS constants:
	</p>

	<ul>
		<li>ATTRIBUTE_READ_ONLY</li>
		<li>ATTRIBUTE_IMMUTABLE</li>
		<li>ATTRIBUTE_OWNER_READ</li>
		<li>ATTRIBUTE_OWNER_WRITE</li>
		<li>ATTRIBUTE_OWNER_EXECUTE</li>
		<li>ATTRIBUTE_GROUP_READ</li>
		<li>ATTRIBUTE_GROUP_WRITE</li>
		<li>ATTRIBUTE_GROUP_EXECUTE</li>
		<li>ATTRIBUTE_OTHER_READ</li>
		<li>ATTRIBUTE_OTHER_WRITE</li>
		<li>ATTRIBUTE_OTHER_EXECUTE</li>
		<li>ATTRIBUTE_EXECUTABLE</li>
		<li>ATTRIBUTE_ARCHIVE</li>
		<li>ATTRIBUTE_HIDDEN</li>
		<li>ATTRIBUTE_SYMLINK</li>
		<li>ATTRIBUTE_LINK_TARGET</li>
	</ul>

	<p>
		The <i>lastModified...</i> fields require the format
		<code>yyyy/MM/dd HH:mm:ss</code>
		.
	</p>

	<h4>
		<a name="Files">2. Managed Files</a>
	</h4>

	<p>
		By "managed file" is meant a local file required by the executable but
		which may not be present on the host on which the job will run; hence,
		these files may either be external or may actually be generated from
		the resource manager environment in conjunction with the job
		submission, but in any case need to be copied to that host just prior
		to it. The
		<code>script</code>
		file used in connection with scheduler (batch) jobs is a special
		category of the
		<code>managed-file</code>
		type, and will be discussed in the next sub-section.
	</p>

	<img alt="ManagedFiles" src="images/05managed-files.jpeg" />

	<p>
		Managed files are added to the definition in groups determined by
		their shared staging location, which is a path relative to the working
		directory of the connection. (The batch script is by default staged to
		<i> .eclipsesettings</i> in the user home directory, since it is by
		default temporary and deleted after the submit call returns; however,
		one can use the
		<code>file-staging-location</code>
		on the
		<code>script</code>
		element to set the path explicitly.) The file itself can be set to be
		deleted after submission (<i>deleteTargetAfterUse</i>; this is
		currently not implemented in the general case) and if the file is
		actually generated by the resource manager, the local temporary copy
		can be deleted or retained (<i>deleteSourceAfterUse</i>). In the
		latter case, one can also distinguish multiple copies of the generated
		file by setting <i>uniqueIdPrefix</i> to true.
	</p>

	<p>The managed file definition allows one of three possibilities as
		to specifying content.</p>
	<ol>
		<li>If it is an external file or one edited perhaps through the
			workspace, one can use the <code>path</code> element to indicate
			location; this can be either a hard-coded path or a reference to a
			property or attribute value.</li>
		<li>The <code>contents</code> element is a string which literally
			represents the file contents. The <i>resolveContents</i> attribute in
			this case is used to indicate whether to pass this string through the
			variable resolver, substituting any references to property or
			attribute values it may contain. However, caution should be exercised
			here in that this string should not contain "${...}" sequences which
			do not actually refer to Eclipse variables (such as batch script
			variables), or the resolution will fail. If <i>resolveContents</i> is
			set to false, you can still provide this text element with a single
			reference to a property or attribute, in which case the value of that
			property or attribute will be used <i>as is</i>, without further
			dereferencing.</li>
		<li>The preferred, and most flexible way to represent the
			contents of a file to be generated, however, is to use the <code>line</code>
			type which is discussed <a href="#LineArg">below</a> in connection
			with the <code>script</code> type.</li>

	</ol>

	<p>When the submit call is executed, managed files are written out,
		if so indicated, and then their target paths are determined as
		follows:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>If the <code>path</code> element is used, the target path
			becomes <i>staging directory / name of pre-existing file</i>;</li>
		<li>If the <code>content</code> or <code>line</code> elements are
			used, the target path becomes <i>staging directory/
				[uniqueIdPrefix]managed-file-name</i>);</li>
		<li>A property is placed in the environment whose <i>name</i> is
			the managed-file <i>name</i> and whose <i>value</i> is this target
			path.</li>
	</ul>

	<h4 align="center">
		<a name="Script">The (Batch) Script Element</a>
	</h4>

	<p>A resource manager definition for a scheduler system such as PBS
		or LoadLeveler can be instrumented to work without a batch script (by
		setting command-line flags or passing all the job control information
		as environment variables, for instance), but most frequently the use
		of a script allows more flexibility in configuring the job
		(interactive managers of course have no need of a script).</p>

	<img alt="ScriptType" src="images/06script.jpeg" />

	<p>
		If the script is specified in the XML definition, its path is
		automatically added to the list of managed files to be staged to the
		appropriate directory (by default <i>.eclipsesettings</i>, or
		whereever indicated by the
		<code>file-staging-location</code>
		element), and so there is no need to include a script entry explicitly
		under the
		<code>managed-files</code>
		element. As with the
		<code>managed-file</code>
		, <i>deleteAfterSubmit</i> indicates that the script target should not
		be retained (this is the default behavior); unlike the
		<code>managed-file</code>
		, however, the local copy of the generated script is always deleted. A
		reserved property,
		<code>managed_file_for_script</code>
		, should be used to reference the script's path on the target
		resource; for instance, in the PBS submit command:
	</p>

	<code>
		&lt;arg&gt;qsub&lt;/arg&gt;<br>
		&lt;arg&gt;${ptp_rm:managed_file_for_script#value}&lt;/arg&gt;
	</code>
	<br>

	<p>
		<b>Note</b>: If the
		<code>import</code>
		tab (see <a href="#LaunchTab">below</a>) is used to provide an
		external or workspace edited batch script to the run, nothing extra
		need be done in the definition XML, as the presence of any external
		path for the script is handled under the covers.
	</p>

	<p>
		<i>insertEnvironmentAfter</i> is a line number indicating where in the
		script to add any extra environment variables set through the <b>Environment</b>
		tab provided as part of the <b>Run Configuration</b> wizard. This way
		the user has control over whether these should overwrite previously
		defined environment variable values.
	</p>

	<p></p>

	<h4 align="center">
		<a name="LineArg"><code>line</code> and <code>arg</code> types</a>
	</h4>

	<p>
		The
		<code>line</code>
		element was mentioned <a href="#Files">above</a> in connection with
		managed file content; it is essentially a wrapper around a series of
		whitespace separated
		<code>arg</code>
		elements, all of which are placed on a single line (that is, the group
		is terminated by a line separator).
	</p>

	<img alt="Line" src="images/07line-arg.jpeg" />

	<p>
		The
		<code>arg</code>
		element is used for script and managed file content as well as in the
		definition of commands. Its text element can contain variable
		references to be resolved against the environment, but also allows for
		the entire string to be treated as a literal by setting <i>resolve</i>
		to false (default is true). This is useful inasmuch as it allows for
		the presence of batch-type variables (e.g., ${HOME}) which should be
		resolved by the remote shell and not inside the Eclipse client.
	</p>
	<p>
		The default behavior of the argument resolver is not to write out or
		include arguments whose value is undefined (either
		<code>null</code>
		or zero-length). <i>isUndefinedIfMatches</i> affords more nuanced
		control over whether an argument should be so eliminated. If the
		argument references property or attribute values, but also has
		text-literal segments, a regex can be provided to define what an
		"empty" argument would be in this case. For instance, if an argument
		flag should not appear when the value it precedes is an empty string,
		one could write:
	</p>

	<code> &lt;arg isUndefinedIfMatches="-f"&gt;-f
		${ptp_rm:flag#value}&lt;/arg&gt; </code>
	<br>

	<p>For the purposes of matching, trailing whitespace is trimmed
		from the resolved argument, so there is no need to specify this as
		part of the regex used to match.</p>

	<h4 align="center">
		<a name="JustInTimeEval">"Just-in-time" resolution of <i>@jobId</i>
			and <code>managed-file</code> paths</a>
	</h4>

	<p>
		<i>@jobId</i> is a special property name designating the runtime id
		for a job instance. In the lifecycle of the run/launch (submit) call,
		this value begins as an internally generated unique id which then is
		swapped for the id returned by the scheduler or runtime system.
	</p>

	<p>
		The <i>@jobId</i>, along with the target paths for
		<code>managed-file</code>
		elements, are not known at configuration time (i.e., before the user
		hits "Run"). While the former is made visible to the parsers and the
		returned status object of the submit command, neither is in the scope
		of (available for reference in) other managed files or the
		<code>script</code>
		element, because these latter elements are generated just prior to the
		actual submission.
	</p>

	<p>
		If the
		<code>script</code>
		needs to refer to the <i>@jobId</i>, it must do so via the variable
		made available by the particular scheduler it is written for. An
		example of how to reference the target path of a
		<code>managed-file</code>
		inside the
		<code>script</code>
		is included in the <a href="JAXBDemo.pdf">tutorial slides</a>; this
		essentially involves defining a variable in the submission command's
		environment, with a reference to the
		<code>managed-file</code>
		path property as its value, and then using this environment variable
		inside the
		<code>script</code>
		.
	</p>

	<h4>
		<a name="CommandsParsers">3. Commands</a>
	</h4>

	<p>
		As mentioned <a href="#CommandTypes">above</a>, the resource manager
		<code>command</code>
		denotes a [UNIX-type] system call made on the resource manager's
		remote (target) connection (PTP does not generally support execution
		on Windows systems). The command is always configured and executed
		through a Java API (the "process builder") which bottoms out in a
		<code>bash -c</code>
		command. The first argument of the command thus must be the name/path
		of the executable only. Its own arguments can then be subsequently
		specified by an arbitrary number of
		<code>arg</code>
		elements.
	</p>

	<img alt="CommandType" src="images/08command.jpeg" />

	<p>
		There are a number of important attributes on the
		<code>command-type</code>
		element which bear detailed discussion here. <i>directory</i> of
		course refers to where the command will be executed; <b>this
			defaults to the "home" or working directory of the remote control
			connection (the <code>control.working.dir</code> property)</b>; also as
		expected, <i>redirectStderr</i> means that both output and error
		streams are sent back on
		<code>stdout</code>
		. One can, if necessary, tune the buffer sizes on the stream readers
		via the <i>streamBufferLimit</i>. If the environment set on the
		command should entirely replace the shell environment (the default
		behavior is to append the command environment), set <i>replaceEnvironment</i>
		to true.
	</p>

	<p>
		If you do not wish an error to be thrown in the case of non-zero exit
		of the command, set <i>ignoreExitStatus</i> to true. The <i>flags</i>
		attribute is an OR'd string of three possible values:
	</p>

	<ul>
		<li>NONE (default)</li>
		<li>ALLOCATE_PTY (allocates a pseudo-terminal)</li>
		<li>FORWARD_X11</li>
	</ul>

	<p>
		Two crucial fields for command control are <i>waitForId</i> and <i>keepOpen</i>.
		The former indicates to the resource manager that the output stream
		for the command is being parsed for an id which will appear as a
		property in the environment during the command execution, and that the
		execution should not return until it sees this id. Very often the
		submit commands will have these semantics. The latter field indicates
		that the command should be held open for potentially repeated
		redirection of input (see next paragraph). There can only be one such
		process open inside the resource manager at a time (these semantics
		will usually pertain to interactive managers using a pseudo-terminal
		mode to control job submission).
	</p>

	<hr>
	<h5>BEST PRACTICE: WAIT-FOR-ID</h5>
	<p>
		As <a href="#CommandTypes">previously</a> described, there are two
		basic types of commands, <b>(uu)id</b> commands which are related to a
		specific job, and generic (non-uuid) commands.
		<code>submit-</code>
		and
		<code>-job-</code>
		commands fall into the former category; those in the latter category
		are usually simple interactive commands, and their output is not
		redirected to the console, but uuid-commands have several subclasses:
	</p>
	<br>
	<table align="CENTER" rules="all">
		<tr>
			<th>COMMAND TYPE</th>
			<th>WAIT FOR ID</th>
			<th>TOKENIZER STATES</th>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>batch</td>
			<td>yes</td>
			<td>SUBMITTED</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>interactive</td>
			<td>no</td>
			<td></td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>interactive</td>
			<td>yes</td>
			<td>RUNNING</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>interactive, open</td>
			<td>no</td>
			<td></td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>interactive, open</td>
			<td>yes</td>
			<td>(SUBMITTED,) RUNNING</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>interactive, open, pseudo-terminal</td>
			<td>no</td>
			<td></td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>interactive, open, pseudo-terminal</td>
			<td>yes</td>
			<td>(SUBMITTED,) RUNNING</td>
		</tr>
	</table>
	<br>
	<p>
		This table shows the various combinations that are feasible between
		command type and waiting states. Simple interactive commands, whether
		held open for further input or not, can wait or not wait, but in the
		case of waiting, they should be provided with a <a
			href="#StreamParsers">stream tokenizer</a> which recognizes and sets
		the RUNNING state. Batch jobs, on the other hand, will usually have a
		tokenizer which recognizes and sets SUBMITTED. In the case of some
		open-process jobs (e.g.,
		<code>qsub -I</code>
		for PBS, which also requires a pseudo-terminal to connect remotely),
		there will usually be a pause before the terminal job is actually
		scheduled; in order to allow the user to see that the job has been
		accepted and is pending, the tokenizer needs to set both SUBMITTED and
		RUNNING states, the latter when the job has actually started.
	</p>
	<hr>

	<p>
		We have discussed the
		<code>arg</code>
		type <a href="#LineArg">above</a>. Note that the command arguments,
		input and even environment variables make use of this element. For the
		<code>name-value-pair</code>
		type comprising the latter one can as simple alternative set the <i>value</i>
		attribute to a string (which will be resolved first in the current
		environment); finer-grained control over the resolution of the value,
		however, requires the use of the
		<code>arg</code>
		type. When there is
		<code>input</code>
		present, it is directed to the input stream of the command. If the <i>keepOpen</i>
		attribute is true, a check will be made to see if there already exists
		an open process (which is also alive), which will then be used;
		otherwise, the arguments are executed, then the input arguments are
		given to the process. With an open command/process, the input
		arguments can be fed repeatedly to the same process; this allows, for
		instance, for continuous testing of an interactive job in the same
		interactive session.
	</p>

	<h4 align="center">
		<a name="StreamParsers">Stream Parsers</a>
	</h4>

	<p>
		One can attach parsers (which we also refer to as tokenizers) to the
		output and error streams of any
		<code>command</code>
		in order to capture information and use it to side-effect existing
		properties or attributes, or to generate new ones on the fly. While
		the parser is not completely general, it is capable of a wide range of
		tasks which would typically be required in the handling of output from
		batch and runtime systems. We here explain the main elements (
		<code>target, match, test</code>
		) used by the tokenizer; one should further consult the <a
			href="#TokenizerExamples">tokenizer examples</a> demonstrating
		various usage scenarios.
	</p>

	<img alt="TokenizerType" src="images/090tokenizer.jpeg" />

	<p>
		The
		<code>type</code>
		element will most commonly not be set, meaning the built-in parser
		will be used; however, it is possible to implement a custom parser as
		a contribution to the
		<code>org.eclipse.ptp.rm.jaxb.core.streamParserTokenizer</code>
		extension point, in which case this element should be set to its
		extension id (note however that such a parser is not configurable from
		the XML document).
	</p>

	<p>
		The built-in tokenizer can read the stream in two different ways. If <i>delim</i>
		is provided, the stream is split using the indicated value. The string
		should only be one character in length (escaped or non-escaped).
		Provision is made for the '\r\n' (Windows) two-character delimiter
		internally; in this case the delimiter should be set to "\r" (however,
		as already mentioned, PTP does not generally guarantee that system
		calls will work on Windows). Setting <i>includeDelim</i> means that
		the delimiter will appear as the last char on the returned stream
		segment.
	</p>

	<p>
		The second way to read from the stream is to provide a <i>maxMatchLen</i>
		size; what this indicates is that whatever substring needs to be found
		on the stream will not exceed this length. The stream is then read in
		swatches of <i>maxMatchLen</i>, with the internal buffer set to twice
		this size, so that each successive read shifts the buffer to the
		"left" by one length. This guarantees that all such substrings will
		eventually be matched.
	</p>

	<p>
		Sometimes a sort of "look-ahead" paradigm is necessary. For instance,
		one may need to match a segment or segments whose position is defined
		from the end of the output, but you do not know in advance the actual
		stream length. In this case, one can opt to read until the end of the
		stream (<i>all</i>="true"), retaining only the last <i>N</i>
		buffer-lengths or delimited segments, as indicated by the <i>save</i>
		field. When the parser reaches the end of the stream, it will then
		apply the various targets to each saved segment in order.
	</p>

	<p>
		<i>applyToAll</i> is discussed further under
		<code>target</code>
		. The
		<code>exit-on</code>
		element indicates that the tokenizer should quit immediately when it
		encounters this pattern;
		<code>exit-after</code>
		indicates that the tokenizer should quit when it encounters this
		pattern, but should first apply the current segment to its targets.
	</p>

	<h5 align="CENTER">
		<a name="TargetType">TARGET</a>
	</h5>

	<img alt="TargetType" src="images/091target.jpeg" />

	<p>
		A tokenizer may be given any number of
		<code>target</code>
		elements. The target denotes a particular value (object) currently in,
		or to be written to, the environment, which will be side-effected on
		the basis of the result of the tokenization. A target in turn contains
		<code>match</code>
		elements and
		<code>test</code>
		elements; the former are run as part of the stream processing; the
		latter are run after the stream processing has been completed.
	</p>

	<p>
		The target object is either to be constructed at match time, or it
		pre-exists in the environment. If constructed, the <i>type</i> field
		is used to indicate whether the object is a
		<code>property</code>
		or an
		<code>attribute</code>
		type; otherwise, <i>ref</i> points to the name of the
		<code>property</code>
		or
		<code>attribute</code>
		in the environment (recall that for the runtime job identifier, <i>@jobId</i>
		is used).
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>Note</b>: when new targets are constructed, there is a merge
		operation at the end of tokenization which attempts to combine objects
		into a single instance identified by their <i>name</i> attribute. This
		assumes that such names will be unique and that any other values to be
		set on the object which are not explicitly bound in some way to that
		name via the match pattern will appear on the stream before a new name
		does (see ex. 5 in <a href="#TokenizerExamples">tokenizer examples</a>).
		<b><i>The default behavior of this merge is that it will fail
				if two objects with the same name but differing values are generated
				by the parsing.</i> (This excludes <code>add</code> and <code>put</code>
			operations which create a list or map; in these cases, the two
			collections or maps will be combined into one. This does <i>NOT</i>
			work, however, for <code>append</code> actions.) To allow duplicates,
			set the <i>allowOverwrites</i> to true; in this case, successive
			duplicates simply replace the preceding object. </b>
	</p>

	<p>The default behavior of the tokenizer read-match sequence is as
		follows:</p>

	<ol>
		<li>read from the stream either a set number of chars or until
			the delimiter is found;</li>
		<li>for each target:
			<ul>
				<li>for each match:
					<ul>
						<li>if the match is positive, process each of the actions,
							and go to (1).</li>
					</ul>
			</ul></li>
	</ol>

	<p>
		Only one qualifying target is processed for any given segment read,
		and for the given target, the first pattern matched is the one
		processed for its actions. This is basically the "OR" semantics of
		normal logic programming; hence <i>the implementer must be careful
			to arrange the matches inside a target in such a way that the more
			specific match patterns precede the more general</i>.
	</p>
	<p>Three boolean fields allow you to modify this behavior.</p>

	<ol>
		<li>The <i>applyToAll</i> field on the <code>tokenizer-type</code>
			element means take the unmatched part of the read stream and pass it
			to the next target, even if there was a previous match; this allows
			you to capture more than one regex pattern per stream segment (see
			ex. 6 in <a href="#TokenizerExamples">tokenizer examples</a>).</li>
		<li>The <i>matchAll</i> field on the <code>target-type</code>
			element means do not try to match an already matched expression until
			all the others are matched (i.e., a logical AND instead of OR governs
			the set of matches at successive calls to the target match
			operation); this allows one to use, for instance, .* repeatedly but
			set different fields of the object with the resulting match (see ex.
			5 in <a href="#TokenizerExamples">tokenizer examples</a>).</li>
		<li>The <i>moveToTop</i> field on the <code>match-type</code>
			element indicates to the tokenizer that the matched target be
			promoted to first position in the list of targets. This is useful
			when there is an ordering which expects types of attributes or
			properties to be grouped in sequence on the stream (see ex. 4 in <a
			href="#TokenizerExamples">tokenizer examples</a>).</li>
	</ol>

	<p>When a match is found, the set of action types it contains are
		all applied.</p>

	<h5 align="CENTER">
		<a name="MatchType">MATCH</a>
	</h5>

	<img alt="MatchType" src="images/10match.jpeg" />

	<p>Each of these types corresponds to an action to be taken on the
		indicated field of the target object.</p>

	<table align="center" rules="all">
		<tr>
			<td><code>set</code></td>
			<td>sets the value of that field</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><code>append</code></td>
			<td>adds to a string buffer, whose string value will be set on
				the field</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><code>add</code></td>
			<td>adds to a list to which the value of that field will be set</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><code>put</code></td>
			<td>places a key-value pair in a map to which the value of that
				field will be set</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><code>throw</code></td>
			<td>throws an exception and (optionally) also sets the value of
				the field</td>
		</tr>
	</table>

	<p>
		The actions listed here all have
		<code>entry-type</code>
		children, either single (
		<code>set, throw</code>
		) or potentially multiple.
	</p>

	<h5 align="CENTER">
		<a name="EntryType">ENTRY</a>
	</h5>

	<img alt="EntryType" src="images/11entry.jpeg" />

	<p>
		This value-abstraction allows one to set <i>key</i> (for maps) and <i>value</i>
		as literals or references to other properties or attributes to be
		resolved in the current environment; to reference the matched segment
		parts one sets <i>keyIndex</i> and <i>valueIndex</i> if the regex was
		used to split the segment; otherwise, <i>keyGroup</i> and <i>valueGroup</i>
		refer to the capture group of the regex pattern, with group 0
		referring to the entire match.
	</p>

	<h5 align="CENTER">
		<a name="TestType">TEST</a>
	</h5>

	<img alt="TestType" src="images/12test.jpeg" />

	<p>
		As mentioned <a href="#TargetType">above</a>, the
		<code>test-type</code>
		elements are all run after the tokenization has reached the end of the
		stream. This class of actions is useful for setting values based on
		other values produced during tokenization. A test is one or more
		comparison operations plus a set of actions to apply to the target
		fields in the case of either success or failure (the "else" element);
		see ex. 3 or the "get-job-status" example in <a
			href="#TokenizerExamples">tokenizer examples</a>.
	</p>

	<p>
		The <i>op</i> attribute can be one of the following comparisons:
	</p>

	<table align="center">
		<tr>
			<td>EQ</td>
			<td>:</td>
			<td>equals</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>LT</td>
			<td>:</td>
			<td>less than</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>LE</td>
			<td>:</td>
			<td>less than or equal to</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>GT</td>
			<td>:</td>
			<td>greater than</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>GE</td>
			<td>:</td>
			<td>greater than or equal to</td>
		</tr>
	</table>

	<p>
		When the operation is set to one of these, it is expected that the two
		<code>value</code>
		elements will be used. As usual, these elements can be literals or can
		contain variables to be resolved into a string type;
		<code>#FIELD</code>
		refers to the value of the given field on the current target; the
		strings will be converted in conformity with the inferred (primitive)
		type of the comparison. The
		<code>else</code>
		element also pertains to comparison tests; the actions listed there
		will be taken upon failure of the comparison.
	</p>

	<p>
		The <i>op</i> attribute can also be a logical operator [AND, OR, NOT],
		in which case the embedded
		<code>test</code>
		object should be used; these can be nested to an arbitrary depth, but
		of course must bottom out in a comparison operation.

	<h4>
		<a name="LaunchTab">4. The Launch Tab</a>
	</h4>

	<p>
		The UI component which needs to be configured in conjunction with the
		resource manager control is the <b>Launch Tab</b>, which is actually
		the main area of the <b>Resources Tab</b>, one of the six tabs
		comprising the <b>Run Configuration</b> wizard or the seven tabs
		comprising the <b>Debug Configuration</b> wizard. The purpose of this
		component is to allow the user to set up the job by providing values
		relating to resource requirements or to the properties of the job in
		general. In other words, it is in this component that the user can set
		the values on the
		<code>attribute</code>
		elements making up the configurable environment as defined in the XML.
	</p>

	<p>
		Specifying the composition and layout of this component can be tricky
		and tedious because it deals with widgets defined by the Eclipse
		<code>JFace</code>
		library and with their underlying implementation in
		<code>SWT</code>
		. We intend in the near future to provide some standard "templates"
		for typical widget groups that can be cut and pasted into the XML
		definition. Some of this can already be achieved by importing into the
		workspace a provided definition (such as for the PBS resource manager)
		and modifying it or borrowing from it. This is, in fact, the approach
		demostrated in the <a href="JAXBDemo.pdf">tutorial</a>.
	</p>

	<p>
		<b> Throughout the following, it may generally be assumed that
			fields such as <i>style</i>, <i>foreground</i>, <i>background</i>,
			etc., take string equivalents of the corresponding <code>SWT</code>
			constants (e.g., "SWT.LEFT", "SWT.VERTICAL", "SWT.NONE") which can be
			OR'd (using "|") wherever they would be in Java code. We will <i>not</i>
			exhaustively specify here which constants pertain to which widgets,
			because in most cases we have tried to reflect very closely the names
			of the <code>SWT</code> object types and fields, and this information
			can be found by consulting the Javadocs relative to the widgets in
			question. </b>
	</p>

	<img alt="LaunchTabType" src="images/13launch-tab.jpeg" />

	<p>
		As seen from this top-level specification, the Launch Tab can have any
		number of
		<code>dynamic</code>
		tab-controllers, "dynamic" meaning configurable from the XML, which
		will discuss in more detail in the following paragraphs.
	</p>
	<p>
		There is also a fixed
		<code>import</code>
		controller type (implemented as an extension/subclass of the dynamic
		controller, in order to provide uniform handling of the environment);
		this component allows you to browse the workspace to set a custom
		script as the one to run. Its main text area widget is read-only; any
		editing of the script must be done through the workspace editor. The
		browse is local only, so remote scripts should first be imported into
		a local project in the workspace (using the remote systems import
		wizard), and then captured by this controller's browse button.
	</p>

	<p>
		The configurable part of the import tab an optional <a
			href="#AttributeViewer">attribute viewer</a> for selecting the
		variables from the environment which you wish to pass to the launch
		command along with the script. <i>The values set here should
			correspond to whatever the script contains; are set for the benefit
			of the internal consistency of the PTP client, and do not override
			those hard-coded in script.</i> For an example, see the <a
			href="PLUGINS_ROOT/org.eclipse.ptp.rm.jaxb.pbs.doc.user/html/PBSHelpPage.html#ImportTab">Import
			PBS Script</a> tab.
	</p>

	<h4 align="CENTER">
		<a name="TabController">Tab Controller</a>
	</h4>

	<p>
		The
		<code>dynamic</code>
		controllers belong to the
		<code>tab-controller-type</code>
		, which contains an arbitrary number of
		<code>tab-folder,</code>
		<code>composite,</code>
		<code>widget,</code>
		<code>browse,</code>
		<code>button-group,</code>
		<code>action,</code>
		or
		<code>viewer</code>
		elements; as will be seen shortly, the first two, which are
		"containers", are potentially recursive elements, so that one can nest
		widgets in the usual manner. For all intents and purposes, the
		<code>tab-controller-type</code>
		is the same as a
		<code>composite</code>
		, but without the <i>group</i> attribute and with the extra field for
		controlling shared widgets.
	</p>

	<img alt="TabController" src="images/14tab-controller.jpeg" />
	<p>
		The <i>includeWidgetValuesFrom</i> field is important. By default, it
		is set to empty, meaning that the subset of the total resource manager
		environment represented by the controller's widgets is all that will
		be passed to the actual job configuration when the job is launched
		from this tab. This behavior can be changed by giving a
		comma-delimited list of the
		<code>title</code>
		values for other controllers. In this case, the configuration for the
		job, when the "Run" button is pressed with this controller being the
		visible one, will also include <i>all the properties or attributes
			valid for the listed but currently invisible controllers</i>.
	</p>
	<hr>
	<h5>PROPERTY/ATTRIBUTE NAMES vs VALUES</h5>

	<p>While this field controls the inclusion or exclusion of
		attribute and property names in the configuration, their values are
		always shared across the controllers (there is only one environment);
		thus if a variable value is changed on one controller, and this
		variable is also exposed on another, the value for that variable will
		also change on the other controller when it becomes visible;
		similarly, if the user switches off a controller to another having
		only a subset of the first controller's variables, the variables not
		represented on the second controller will become undefined or return
		to their defaults.</p>
	<p>
		<b>Note</b> that the union of valid names is transively closed; that
		is, if Tab1 has <i>includeWidgetValuesFrom</i>="Tab2", and Tab2
		similarly has <i>includeWidgetValuesFrom</i>="Tab3", Tab1 will get the
		valid names from Tab2 and Tab3. <b>Note</b> also, however, that if
		there are names which intersect with strictly local widget targets,
		the local settings (visibility, selection, enablement) still determine
		whether they belong in the set of valid property/attribute names.
	</p>
	<hr>
	<p>
		The <i>showViewConfig</i> and <i>showViewExcluded</i> fields allow
		control over whether the "View Configuration" and "View Excluded"
		buttons appear at the bottom of the tab (the "View Script" button
		appears if the configuration contains a
		<code>script</code>
		element). <i>showViewConfig</i> is true by default; this button brings
		up a scrolling dialog which allows you to inspect the current
		configuration (that is, the one relevant to the visible controller). <i>showViewExcluded</i>
		is by default false, and should only be set if the resource manager
		processes attributes or properties discovered by a command at run
		time; this dialog allows you to see which ones have been marked
		invisible; <b>unlike invisible predefined properties or attributes</b>,
		which are always <i>included</i>, invisible discovered properties or
		attributes are always <i>excluded</i> from the configuration and thus
		do not persist across resource manager sessions.

	<h4 align="CENTER">
		<a name="TabFolders">Tab Folders and Tab Items</a>
	</h4>

	<img alt="TabFolder" src="images/15tab-folder.jpeg" />
	<p>
		The
		<code>tab-folder</code>
		is a container which looks like a file-folder, with tabs running
		across the top or bottom (<i>style</i> includes SWT.TOP, SWT.BOTTOM).
		Each tab label corresponds to a
		<code>tab-item</code>
		which provides the actual visible content. The
		<code>tooltip</code>
		pertains to the entire folder.
	</p>

	<p>
		The
		<code>tab-item</code>
		is another all-purpose "container" in which all widget types can be
		embedded, but distinguished from the <a href="#Composite"><code>composite</code>
		</a> in that it can only be the child of a
		<code>tab-folder</code>
		and that it can have a tooltip (which appears on the tab).
	</p>

	<p>
		As with
		<code>composite</code>
		(see <a href="#Composite">below</a>), the tab folder and tab item take
		<code>layout</code>
		and
		<code>layout-data</code>
		elements; these closely reflect their
		<code>SWT</code>
		objects and types; for further explanation we refer the reader once
		again to the relevant Javadocs.

		and a title, while the simple composite acts as a widget holder and
		has no visible characteristics, though it does have a layout. As is
		evident, composites can be contained in composites and tab-items, and
		tab-folders can be contained in composites.

	<img alt="Composite" src="images/22control-state.jpeg" />
	<br>

	<p>
		The purpose of these elements is to provide an optional way of setting
		the <b>enabled</b> and/or <b>visible</b> states of the control on the
		basis of the state of button (checkbox/radio) selection. One can
		define two such elements per control, using one of the show/hide or
		enable/disable pairs. Each of these is associated with a
		<code>control-state-rule:</code>
	</p>

	<img alt="Composite" src="images/23control-state-rule.jpeg" />
	<br>

	<p>The basic rule is defined by its attributes:</p>

	<ol>
		<li>the id of the button control to check;</li>
		<li>whether its selected state should be true or false</li>
	</ol>

	<p>Rules can be nested to an arbitrary depth to form clauses
		governed by the logical operators.</p>

	<p>
		A
		<code>SelectionListener</code>
		is created for this target which subscribes to all the controls in the
		rule; when it receives an event, it evaluates the rule, and if the
		result is true, takes the associated action on this target.
	</p>

	<p>
		When one wishes to wire two or more such controls in this way, the
		"trigger" button control must have an id unique to the resource
		manager configuration. This will be assigned via the <i>buttonId</i>
		element on the
		<code>widget</code>
		corresponding to the button (true also for the buttons nested in a
		<code>button-group</code>
		).
	</p>

	<p>Here is an example which sets the enabled and visible properties
		of both a text field and a related checkbox:</p>

	<pre>
               &lt;widget type="checkbox" buttonId="002" title="Host list:" saveValueTo="checked002"&gt;
                  &lt;layout-data&gt;
                     &lt;grid-data horizontalAlign="SWT.LEFT" verticalAlign="SWT.TOP"/&gt;
                  &lt;/layout-data&gt;
                  &lt;control-state&gt;
                     &lt;show-if button="001" selected="true"/&gt;
                  &lt;/control-state&gt;
               &lt;/widget&gt;
               &lt;widget type="text" style="SWT.V_SCROLL | SWT.BORDER" saveValueTo="host_list"&gt;
                  &lt;layout-data&gt;
                     &lt;grid-data horizontalAlign="SWT.FILL" verticalAlign="SWT.FILL" horizontalSpan="2" grabExcessHorizontal="true"
                        grabExcessVertical="true"/&gt;
                  &lt;/layout-data&gt;
                  &lt;control-state&gt;
                     &lt;show-if button="001" selected="true"/&gt;
                     &lt;enable-if&gt;
                        &lt;and&gt;
                           &lt;rule button="001" selected="true"/&gt;
                           &lt;rule button="002" selected="true"/&gt;
                        &lt;/and&gt;
                     &lt;/enable-if&gt;
                  &lt;/control-state&gt;
               &lt;/widget&gt; 
   </pre>

	<p>Note also that this implicit dependency graph is checked for
		cycles; the building of the UI tab will be aborted if such a cycle is
		discovered.</p>

	<hr>
	<h5>BEST PRACTICE: CONTROL STATE</h5>
	<p>
		An invisible property should be assigned to each checkbox which
		controls the state of other widgets (e.g., <i>checked002</i> in the
		example above); this will allow you to restore the state of the tab
		correctly when it is rebuilt or re-initialized.
	</p>
	<br>
	<hr>
	<h4 align="CENTER">
		<a name="Widget">Widget</a>
	</h4>

	<p>
		We now come to the five non-container widget elements with functional
		characteristics. The first of these is the
		<code>widget</code>
		, which comprises a number of simple widget types.
	<p>
	<p>
		The <i>type</i> of the widget can be one of the following:
	</p>

	<br>
	<table align="center" rules="all">
		<tr>
			<td><code>label</code></td>
			<td>fixed text for display</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><code>text</code></td>
			<td>area for entering/editing text</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><code>checkbox</code></td>
			<td>corresponds to a boolean choice</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><code>radiobutton</code></td>
			<td>usually used in connection with <code>button-group</code></td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><code>spinner</code></td>
			<td>provides a continuous range of integer values</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><code>combo</code></td>
			<td>select from a list of items</td>
		</tr>
	</table>
	<br>

	<p>
		Not all attributes and elements of the
		<code>widget</code>
		descriptor are applicable to all types.
	</p>
	<br>
	<table align="center" rules="all">
		<tr>
			<td><i>title</i></td>
			<td>used with <code>checkbox</code> and <code>radiobutton</code>
				widgets for the button label</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><i>style</i></td>
			<td>carries the <code>SWT</code> style constants appropriate to
				the widget type</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><i>readOnly</i></td>
			<td>applies to <code>text</code>, <code>spinner</code> and <code>combo</code>
				widgets; the text area in this case is not editable</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><i>saveValueTo</i></td>
			<td>applies to all widgets except <code>label</code>; the name
				of the property or attribute whose value should be set on the basis
				of the widget's "selected" value or text<br> <b>Note:</b> use
				of this attribute is mutually exclusive with the <code>fixed-</code>
				and <code>dynamic-text</code> elements.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><i>translateBooleanAs</i></td>
			<td>applies to the <code>checkbox</code> widget; a
				comma-delimited pair indicating a string equivalent for the boolean
				to be used as the actual value for the property or attribute set by
				the widget<br> <i>Example</i>: "YES,NO" would mean true yields
				the first string and false the second</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><code>items-from</code></td>
			<td>applies to the <code>combo</code> widget; indicates a
				property or attribute <i>value</i> (of type <code>java.util.Collection</code>)
				to use to populate the items<br> <b>Note:</b> if a combo widget
				saves its value to an attribute and the present element on the
				widget descriptor is not set, the attribute will be checked for
				non-empty <code>choice</code> or <code>items-from</code> values,
				which then will be used to populate the combo items; the <code>items-from</code>
				field on the widget is for added flexibility (for instance, linking
				up a target property with another property providing the list of
				choices)</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><code>fixed-text</code></td>
			<td>applies to the <code>label</code> and (read-only) <code>text</code>
				widgets; text is resolved once and remains constant thereafter</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><code>dynamic-text</code></td>
			<td>applies only to (read-only) <code>text</code> widgets; text
				is resolved each time there is an update of a value from the Launch
				Tab</td>
		</tr>
	</table>
	<br>

	<p>Widget foreground, background (color) and font are in principle
		configurable, though the font setting may not always work. The tooltip
		will appear on the widget whereever it usually does.</p>
	<br>

	<h4 align="CENTER">
		<a name="ButtonGroup">Button Group</a>
	</h4>

	<img alt="ButtonGroup" src="images/20button-group.jpeg" />

	<p>
		The button group provides an explicit selection of a single value
		based on a mutually exclusive set of button labels. Just as with the
		<code>widget</code>
		, one uses <i>saveValueTo</i> to indicate what property or attribute
		value to set. The
		<code>button</code>
		elements, which can be arranged horizontally or vertically using the <i>style</i>
		attribute (SWT.HORIZONTAL, SWT.VERTICAL), will be
		<code>widget</code>
		elements whose type is either <i>checkbox</i> or <i>radiobutton</i>
		(if a different widget type is given, an error will occur); the <i>saveValueTo</i>
		attribute on the individual button will be ignored. Radio buttons are
		"sticky" in the sense that once they are selected, they cannot be
		"unchecked" until a different button in the group is selected. It is
		thus advisable always to provide a default value for the property or
		attribute associated with the group value if radio buttons are used.
		If check boxes are used, they can be individually checked on and off
		(one at a time), thus allowing for the value of the group to be
		potentially empty.
	</p>

	<p>Below is an example of a button group using radio buttons,
		disposed vertically.</p>
	<br>
	<img alt="ButtonGroupExample" src="images/ButtonGroup.jpeg" />
	<br>
	<br>

	<h4 align="CENTER">
		<a name="Browse">Browse</a>
	</h4>

	<img alt="BrowseType" src="images/190browse.jpeg" />

	<p>
		A special widget-pair -- a text widget followed by a push button --
		allowing the user to browse directories or files from either the local
		or remote file system. Aside from the fields shared with the
		<code>widget</code>
		type, we note the following:
	</p>
	<br>
	<table align="center" rules="all">
		<tr>
			<td><i>directory</i></td>
			<td>limit the <code>browse</code> widget to directories</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><i>uri</i></td>
			<td>have the <code>browse</code> widget set a URI as the text
				(default is false, in which case the text is an absolute path)</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><i>localOnly</i></td>
			<td>limit the <code>browse</code> widget to the local file
				system (otherwise, the choice of local or remote is enabled)</td>
		</tr>
	</table>
	<br>
	<p>
		Control ids,
		<code>layout</code>
		and
		<code>control-state</code>
		are specified as belonging to either the text or the button. Style
		applies only to the text widget.
	</p>
	<br>

	<h4 align="CENTER">
		<a name="Action">Action Button</a>
	</h4>

	<br>
	<img alt="ActionType" src="images/191push-button.jpeg" />
	<br>

	<p>
		A push button which is associated with a
		<code>button-action</code>
		command. The
		<code>button-action</code>
		specifies the name of a command (
		<code>action</code>
		) defined in the XML; this can be one of the
		<code>start-up</code>
		or
		<code>shut-down</code>
		commands, or a special
		<code>button-action</code>
		command (<b>note </b>that it cannot, however, be a
		<code>-job</code>
		command, as the Launch Tab is not coupled to any submitted jobs); the
		<code>button-action-type</code>
		also indicates whether the variable affected by the command should be
		cleared prior to the command execution, and whether the launch tab
		should be refreshed (default is true) afterward.
	</p>
	<br>

	<h4 align="CENTER">
		<a name="AttributeViewer">Attribute Viewer</a>
	</h4>

	<img alt="AttributeViewerType" src="images/21attribute-viewer.jpeg" />

	<p>
		The last of the widget types, the
		<code>attribute-viewer</code>
		, displays visible properties and attributes in a table or tree
		viewer, with the value columns as editable widgets. The type of cell
		editor is determined implicitly here by the type of the property or
		attribute; the presence of a combo editor is determined by an
		attribute whose
		<code>choice</code>
		or
		<code>items-from</code>
		element is defined. (This is the only viable possibility for a combo
		in the table, as there would also need to be a target to save the
		selected item to, viz., the value of this same attribute.)
	</p>

	<p>Each entry in the viewer is provided with a checkbox to indicate
		which attributes have been chosen. A checkbox is also placed above the
		viewer to allow for filtering the unchecked items. The viewer outputs
		its checked values to the environment (and on update removes
		unselected ones). The name of the viewer is also stored against a
		string of all selected values, constructed from a template (further
		discussion at the end of this section).</p>

	<p>
		The viewer <i>type</i> can be either "table" or "tree"; in the case of
		the tree, the type, default, status and description fields of the
		attribute or property are displayed as collapsible child rows hanging
		off the main name entry. Either table or tree can have up to <b>six</b>
		columns whose names/types are based on the following property and
		attribute fields:
	</p>

	<table align="center" rules="all">
		<tr>
			<td><b>Name</b></td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><b>Value</b></td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><b>Type</b></td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><b>Status</b></td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><b>Default</b></td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><b>Description</b></td>
		</tr>
	</table>
	<br>
	<p>
		These can appear in any order. There is a slight difference in how
		these columns are treated, depending upon whether <i>tree</i> or <i>table</i>
		is chosen as type. For <b>table</b> type, the value of the field
		simply appears in the corresponding column:
	</p>
	<br>
	<img alt="Table" src="images/Table.jpg" />
	<br>
	<br>
	<p>
		In the <b>tree</b> type, the
		<code>name</code>
		field displays all fields except
		<code>value</code>
		as children;
		<code>value</code>
		always appears as a separate column on the same row as the name (it
		contains the cell editor). If the viewer also has the column
		corresponding to the child field, that field value appears in that
		column;
	</p>

	<br>
	<img alt="Tree1" src="images/Tree1.jpg" />
	<br>
	<br>

	<p>
		Otherwise, the child fields display their value in the value column
		along with the actual
		<code>value</code>
		field:
	</p>

	<br>
	<img alt="Tree2" src="images/Tree2.jpg" />
	<br>
	<br>

	<p>
		Tooltips for the column appear when hovering over the column header. (<i>A
			caveat on the foreground and background settings for this type: they
			are exposed here but may not work as expected: these are currently
			applied to the column through the cell label provider; foreground
			does not change the font color but applies the color to the entire
			cell.</i>)
	</p>

	<p>
		<i>sort</i> is done on the name field/column. This is a toggle sort,
		such that alternate clicks reverse the sort direction. <i>headerVisible</i>
		and <i>linesVisible</i> control the look of the table. <i>tooltipEnabled</i>
		enables column-viewer label provider tooltip support. The tooltip
		defined for an attribute will appear on the row of the table or the
		parent node of the tree. The attribute description will also appear as
		a tooltip on the description columns if they exist.
	</p>

	<p>
		Control over the actual contents of the viewer is achieved through the
		<code>viewer-items-type</code>
		; one can here explicitly list properties or attributes for inclusion
		using the
		<code>include</code>
		element, or one can set one or both of the <i>all</i> attributes; in
		the latter case, attributes and properties can be excluded from the
		set using
		<code>exclude</code>
		. The <i>initialCheckAll</i> field, which defaults to true, indicates
		that if the attribute or property is new or undefined from a previous
		session, it will appear as checked; turn this off if you want new
		attributes or properties to appear at first as unchecked.
	</p>

	<p>
		A property bearing the name given to this widget is written to the
		environment at each update/refresh; the value of the property is a
		string formed from the selected (checked) rows of the table using the
		<code>template-type</code>
		(the
		<code>value</code>
		element). The <i>pattern</i> can be any literal string embedding <i>@name</i>
		and <i>@value</i> tags as placeholders for the row's name and value;
		for instance, '@name="@value"' would generate a string of name-value
		assignments. The default <i>separator</i> between patterned segments
		is a single space.
	</p>

	<p>Below is a fuller example of the tree version of the attribute
		viewer. The text area above it displays the current value of its
		templated pattern string. The child rows reporting status, default,
		etc., cannot be selected or unselected (only the parent row can).
		Hovering over the name (here walltime) displays the tooltip.</p>
	<br>
	<img alt="AttributeViewerTree" src="images/AttribViewerTree.jpeg" />
	<br>

	<h3>
		<a name="MonitorType">The Monitor Data Type</a>
	</h3>

	<p>At present, the monitor component has less elements to define;
		this may change in future releases, when certain hard-coded features
		of the driver may be handed over to the client for configuration.</p>

	<img alt="MonitorType" src="images/24monitor.jpeg" />

	<p>
		This component can be furnished with its own set of properties
		(currently unused). What is necessary to set at present is only the <i>schedulerType</i>
		attribute (e.g., "PBS"). <i>refreshFrequencyInSeconds</i> defaults to
		60, but this can be changed according to the needs of the user. Be
		aware that too low a setting will probably not work, as the command on
		an average sized system will take upwards of five seconds to complete
		(XML is being streamed to the driver and a
		<code>diff</code>
		is sent back to the client ).
	</p>

	<p>
		If the
		<code>driver</code>
		element is configured, then the default behavior, which is to stage
		over the necessary driver scripts to the <i>.eclipsesettings</i>
		directory in the user's home, is overridden by connecting to a
		pre-existent installation. This can be specified either using the
		<code>url</code>
		, or a combination of the
		<code>name</code>
		,
		<code>path</code>
		and
		<code>args</code>
		elements.
