	<h2>
		<a name="XSD"></a>XML Schema<br>
	</h2>

	<p>
		PTP is <b><i>model-driven</i> </b>; this means
		that its functioning and appearance are determined by a set of
		definitions provided via an XML file. What follows is a detailed
		explanation of the schema governing the resource manager XML
		definition. The latest version of the target configuration schema is available at the URL <a href="http://eclipse.org/ptp/schemas/rm">http://eclipse.org/ptp/schemas/rm</a>.
	</p>

	<p>
		The top level of the XML configuration is the <code>resource-manager-data</code> type as shown in the diagram below.
		This type specifies all the information needed in order to submit, control, and monitor jobs on a target system.
	</p>

	<p>
		The <code>resource-manager-data</code> comprises three elements: <code>site-data</code>,
		<code>control-data</code> and <code>monitor-data</code>. In addition, a configuration name 
		is specified using the <i>name</i> property. This name must be unique.
	</p>

	<p>
		The <code>site-data</code> element is reserved for future use. It provides an optional place to set fixed
		or default remote site information. The connection strings are URIs
		which are specific to the PTP RemoteServices definitions. The scheme
		for these URIs will usually name the specific remote service (e.g,
		<code>rse:</code>
		or
		<code>remotetools:</code>
		; local is simply
		<code>file:</code>
		). The host name and port given here will appear as defaults in the
		resource manager selection wizard when you create a new connection.
	</p>

	<p>
		The principal section of the schema is devoted to defining the
		target system <code>control-data</code> part. The top-level control elements
		include attributes, files to be staged, job script to
		be generated (if any), commands specific to the resource manager, and
		the layout of the launch configuration Resources tab.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		The <code>monitor-data</code> section of the schema specifies the type of monitoring
		to be used for the target system, and any monitoring system specific information
		that might be necessary. If the <code>monitor-data</code> section is omitted, monitoring
		for the target system will be disabled. This is typically the case when 
		configuring direct access to runtime systems such as MPICH2 or Open MPI.
