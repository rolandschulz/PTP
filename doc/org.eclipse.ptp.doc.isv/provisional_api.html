<h1>Remote System Explorer API Status</h1>
<h2>Provisional API</h2>
<div class="p">
<p>Although RSE API has been reviewed and proven useful in earlier proprietary 
versions, we want to give the Open Source Communitiy a chance to provide public
feedback and help further improving the APIs. Therefore,</p>

<p><b>As of RSE 1.0, all API is considered provisional.</b></p>

<p>This means, that we reserve the right to change any API after RSE 1.0
in a not backward compatible way. All such API changes will be voted on
by committers on the <a href="https://dev.eclipse.org/mailman/listinfo/dsdp-tm-dev">
dsdp-tm-dev</a> developer mailing list, and documented in a migration guide
for future releases. We expect that with Community Feedback, we'll reach a 
stable, hardened API for RSE 2.0. Please give your feedback on 
<a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/">Eclipse Bugzilla</a>
under category DSDP, Product Target Management.</p>
