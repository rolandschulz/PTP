<h1>Parallel Tools Platform API Status</h1>
<h2>Provisional API</h2>
<div class="p">
<p>Although PTP API has been reviewed and proven useful in earlier proprietary 
versions, we want to give the Open Source Communitiy a chance to provide public
feedback and help further improving the APIs. Therefore,</p>

<p><b>As of PTP 1.0, all API is considered provisional.</b></p>

<p>This means, that we reserve the right to change any API after PTP 1.0
in a not backward compatible way. We will attempt to announce such API changes 
on the <a href="https://dev.eclipse.org/mailman/listinfo/ptp-dev">
ptp-dev</a> developer mailing list, and ensure they are documented in a migration guide
for future releases.</p>
