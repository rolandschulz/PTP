<h1>Remote System Explorer Extension Points</h1>

<p>
This product is built on the Eclipse platform 
(<A href="http://www.eclipse.org">www.eclipse.org</A>)
 and so it offers all the
capabilities of Eclipse. This includes the ability to create new Eclipse plug-ins to contribute
additional functions to Eclipse. You can write plug-ins using Java, using Eclipse itself (or this product),
with the Plug-in Development Environment (PDE) perspective. Plug-ins contain a file named <code>plugin.xml</code> that
registers their functions. All such functions are created by use of <b>extension points</b>.
These are either supplied by Eclipse or by other plug-ins. The plugin.xml file describes which extension
points are being exploited by each plug-in, and for each identifies the Java class that supplies the
additional functions. Each extension point identifies a Java interface (or base class) that
classes exploiting the extension point must implement (or extend).
</p>
<p>
There are many Eclipse-supplied extension points, as described in
this product's online help. In addition to the Eclipse extension points, there
are unique Remote System Explorer extension points that enable you to contribute property pages and
pop-up menu actions to remote objects within the Remote Systems view, among other things. The base Eclipse extension
points are not sufficient for these, as they do not allow scoping of those property pages and
actions such that they only appear for certain remote objects meeting specific filtering criteria.
</p>

<p>
Here we will introduce the unique extension points defined by the Remote System Explorer. They are
further described in the reference section. These extension points are specifically designed to make
it easy to contribute functions to the pop-up menus of remote objects displayed in the Remote
Systems view. These extension points are defined in the plugin.xml file of the
<code>org.eclipse.rse.core</code> plugin, which you will find in the plugins sub-folder of your
installation directory. This file has comment blocks that offer further information about the
extension points defined in it.

Here are the extension points that are defined by the RSE:

<!-- TODO
  should we add a reference to the runtime-options here,
  instead of the old rseConfigDefaults extension point?

  <TD>For solution providers that are building a product that includes RSE, 
  these runtime options allow you to pre-set some out-of-box preference 
  values. For example, whether the New Connection tree item is shown in 
  Remote Systems view.</TD>
