<h1>Using the Remote System Explorer API</h1>
<p>In addition to all the programming API provided by Eclipse, the Remote System Explorer itself
comes with numerous classes and interfaces that may be of value to programmers extending the RSE.
Typically, these are used in conjunction with the <a href="Extensions.html">extension points</a>
defined by the RSE.
<p>
The API set supplied by the RSE can be roughly partitioned into three areas:
<ol>
<li><a href="api/uiAPI.html">User interface</a> support, to make it easier to author plug-ins that extend or use the RSE.
<li><a href="api/resourceAPI.html">Remote resources</a> support, to enable access to remote resources via predefined subsystems.
<li><a href="api/modelAPI.html">Model</a> support, to enable traversal of the RSE model, to access connections, subsystem factories, subsystems, filters, and so on.
</ol>
</p>
<p>
This guide will introduce the capabilities of the API, leaving the programming details to the 
reference section.</p>

<h2>Provisional API</h2>

<tr><td>
<p>Although RSE API has been reviewed and proven useful in earlier proprietary 
versions, we want to give the Open Source Communitiy a chance to provide public
feedback and help further improving the APIs. Therefore,</p>

<p><b>As of RSE 1.0, all API is considered provisional.</b></p>

<p>This means, that we reserve the right to change any API after RSE 1.0
in a not backward compatible way. All such API changes will be voted on
by committers on the <a href="https://dev.eclipse.org/mailman/listinfo/dsdp-tm-dev">
dsdp-tm-dev</a> developer mailing list, and documented in a migration guide
for future releases. We expect that with Community Feedback, we'll reach a 
stable, hardened API for RSE 2.0. Please give your feedback on 
<a href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/">Eclipse Bugzilla</a>
under category DSDP, Product Target Management.</p>
