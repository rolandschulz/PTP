<h1>Local vs Remote Projects</h1>
<p>PTP can operate on both local and remote projects.
<p>
Local projects exist on the local machine (the same machine on which Eclipse is installed).
The files of a remote project exist on a remote target machine, which may be the same machine
on which the remote build, run, and debug happens, although this can vary.

<p>
Remote projects can use at least two different types of Remote Providers:
<ul>
<li>Remote Tools
</li>
<li>Remote Systems Explorer (RSE)
</ul>
<p><a href="PLUGINS_ROOT/org.eclipse.ptp.rdt.doc.user/html/toc.html">Remote
	Development Tools</a> requires a "Remote Provider" for its Remote C/C++ projects.
You choose which of these your projects uses in the "Remote Provider" selection box of the New Remote Project dialog.

<li>
<a href="http://www.eclipse.org/dsdp/tm">Remote Systems Explorer</a> (RSE) is  is part of the DSDP Target   
Management project. It's a complete remote environment that supports a   
variety of protocols.  RSE must be installed separately from PTP. 
(PTP pre-reqs should pull in RSE requirements.  Need to confirm.)
The section on 
<a href="PLUGINS_ROOT/org.eclipse.ptp.rdt.doc.user/html/toc.html">Remote Development Tools</a> 
is written describing the use of RSE as the remote service provider.
</li>
&nbsp;
<li>
Remote Tools is a light-weight ssh-only set of tools for communicating   
with remote systems. It is part of PTP. 
More information about Remote Tools as a remote service provider is in the section about
<a href="02resMgrSetup.html#remote">remote Resource Managers</a>.
