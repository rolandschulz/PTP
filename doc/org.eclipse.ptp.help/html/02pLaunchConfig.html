<h1 id="top">Launching Parallel Programs</h1>
<p>This describes how to launch a parallel program on a local machine, with a local
resource manager, which should have been set up as described in 
<a href="02resMgrSetup.html">Resource Managers</a> under the description for a local resource manager.
See also <a href="02pLaunchConfigRemote.html">Launching parallel programs remotely</a>.
<p>Topics  include:
<ul>
<li>selecting the machine to run on
<li>selecting executable to run
<li>supplying resource requirements 
<li>debugger information (??)
<!--  TODO not finished debugger info? -->
</ul>

<h2>The parallel launch configuration dialog</h2>
<p>Note: Make sure the resource manager is running before creating
a launch configuration.
<ul>
<li>Open the run configuration dialog (Run -> Open Run Dialog...)
or click the run icon on the tool bar and select Open Run Dialog...
<li>Create a new Parallel Application by clicking "Parallel Application" and
then clicking on the "New" button icon.
<br>

<p>Enter a name for the configuration in the "Name:" field.
Here we use the same name as the project.
<li>In the Main Tab:</li>
<ul>
<li>Choose a resource manager (Note: a resource manager
must be running for it to appear in the drop-down list of resource managers here.)
</li>
<li>Choose the Parallel Project</li>
<li>Choose the Application Program (executable) from the project
<br>(it is probably located in the Debug folder of your project, if this is a debug configuration)
</li>

<p>&nbsp;
<li>If you wish to have the output from all processes in a single output console,
check the "Display combined output in a console view" option.

</ul>
<p>&nbsp;
<li>Select the Arguments tab
<ul>
<li>Enter any <i>program</i> arguments</li>
<li>Change working directory if necessary

<p>&nbsp;
</li>

</ul>
<li>Select the Resources Tab</li>
<ul>

<li>Enter the number of processes to run, which was probably
set to "0" initially. Enter a value > 0.

</li>
</ul>
<p>
<li>Select the Debugger Tab</li>
<ul>
<li>Select the Debugger that will control the parallel processes
by selecting "SDM" (the PTP's Scalable Debug Manager) from the selection menu.
</li>
<p>Under Debugger options, assure that the path
to debugger executable is correct (it is probably in your 
eclipse/plugins/org.eclipse.ptp.<i>os.arch</i>/bin directory,
where <i>os.arch</i> is your operating system and architecture, e.g.
org.eclipse.ptp.linux.x86)
<br>For Debugger session address, assuming you are creating a local launch, it should already be filled in with "localhost" or "localhost.localdomain"

<br><img src="images/launch5.png">
</ul>
<li>Click on  <b>Run</b> to launch the program.
</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;
<li>The parallel program begins execution...

</ul>
