<h1 id="top">Launching Parallel Programs</h1>
<h2>The parallel launch configuration dialog</h2>
<p>Topics  include:
<ul>
<li>selecting the machine to run on
<li>selecting executable to run
<li>supplying resource requirements (currently only number of  
processes, but this will include other requirements, such as scheduler information, later)
<li>debugger information (this is not finished yet)
</ul>
<p>This section explains how to launch a parallel program.

<h2>The old way to launch parallel programs</h2>
<p>You can launch parallel programs the old way, directly from eclipse, without PTP,
by using the <a href="02pLaunchOld.html">external tools and launch dialogs</a>.
<p>But limitations of the old way include:
<ul>
<li>No indication of job or process status
<li>Cannot easily interact with a job scheduler
<li>Must have MPI installed on local machine
<li>No access to individual stdout of processes
<li>No ability to debug program
</ul>

<h2>The New Way: Launching Parallel Programs</h2>
<ul>
<li>Open the run configuration dialog (Run ->Run...)
or click the run icon on the tool bar and select Run...
<li>Create a new Parallel Application by clicking "Parallel Application" and
then clicking on the "New" button below.
<br>

<p>Enter a name for the configuration in the "Name:" field.
<li>In the Main Tab:</li>
<ul>

<li>Choose the project</li>
<li>Choose the executable from the project (see red arrows)</li>
<br><img src="images/launch2.gif">
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;
<li>Select the Arguments tab
<ul>
<li>Enter any <i>program</i> arguments</li>
<li>Change working directory if necessary
<br>
<img src="images/launch3.gif">
<p>&nbsp;
</li>

</ul>
<li>Select the Parallel Tab</li>
<ul>
<li>Choose the machine that the job will run on
</li>
<li>Enter the number of processes to run, which was probably
set to "0" initially. Enter a value > 0.  
This will dismiss the Error at the top of the 
dialog which reports "[Parallel]: Value must be an Integer."
Actually, this should probably say "an integer greater than zero."

</li>
</ul>

<li>Select the Debugger Tab</li>
<ul>
<li>Select the Debugger that will control the parallel processes
by selecting "SDM" (the PTP's Scalable Debug Manager) from the selection menu.
</li>
<li>This will dismiss the Error at the top of the 
dialog which reports "[Debugger]: No debugger available."</li>
<br><img src="images/launch5.gif">
</ul>
<li>Click on Apply, then Run.
</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;
<li>The parallel program begins execution...

</ul>
