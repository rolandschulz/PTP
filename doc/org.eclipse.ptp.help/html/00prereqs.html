<p>The PTP Release 2.0 (early 2007) requires the base Eclipse platform, the CDT, and MPI.
<ul>
<li>Java 1.5 or later
<li><b>Eclipse</b> platform: Version  3.3.1.1 or later
<li>C or Fortran programming environment.  One of the following:
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.eclipse.org/cdt/">CDT</a> C/C++ Development Toolkit for Eclipse
Version 4.0.2 or later
<li><b>Photran</b> (for Fortran, or also works for C/C++ files.  
Wherever CDT is mentioned, Photran projects and files,
for C/C++, should also work, although this is not very thoroughly tested).  
<li><a href="http://www.eclipse.org/photran/">Photran</a> Eclipse plug-ins for Fortran
</ul>
<li>MPI
- Support for MPI is currently only available using Open MPI version 1.0.2 or 1.2
