<p>
When you create a new resource manager, you are able to select a number of different types
(Open MPI, PBS, etc.) One of these types is "Generic Remote Launch." 
This resource manager will simply run an executable on a remote machine using ssh. 
Using this resource manager on a simple serial program is a good way to ensure that the basic ssh functionality is working correctly.
<p>To create a Generic Remote Launch resource manager, open the 
Parallel Runtime Perspective and right-click in the Resource Managers view.
<p>

<p>Select the Generic Remote Launch type of Resource Manager and click Next.

<p>&nbsp;
<p>In the Connection Configuration Dialog, fill in the connection information including the 
Remote Service Provider (e.g. Remote Tools) and the Connection name.
If you have not already <a href="02resMgrSetup.html#remote">configured a connection,</a> 
you can do it here.
Tunneling Options allow communication to be tunneled over a single connection if 
supported by the remote service provider. 
To enable tunneling, select the SSH port forwarding radio button.
<p>
Click Next, or Finish.

this resource manager.  Then click Finish.

<p>&nbsp;
<p>Now, to run a program with the Generic Remote Launch Resource Manager,
create a simple remote project.  Create a run configuration for a Parallel Application, and select the Generic Remote Launch Resource Manager that you just created.
When you run, your program should run on the remote machine.
