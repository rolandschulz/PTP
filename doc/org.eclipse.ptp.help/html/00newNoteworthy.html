<h1>Parallel Tools Platform (PTP) Release 2.0 - New and Noteworthy</h1>
<p>
This version has had many enhancements and bug fixes since the 1.1.1  
release. Some of the major new features include:
<ul>
<li>Monitor/launch/debug on multiple systems
<p>
2.0 allows multiple systems to be configured simultaneously. Machine  
and node status is displayed for each system, and jobs can be launched  
and debugged onto the different machines from within a single Eclipse  
session.

<li>Support for resource managers
<p>
Adds support for job schedulers as well as interactive runtime  
systems. Support for LoadLeveler is included by default. Additional  
job schedulers (e.g. PBS, LSF, SLURM, etc.) will become available in  
the future.

<li>Remote monitoring, launch and debugging
<p>
In 1.1.1, Eclipse had to be running on the same machine that the  
parallel job was launched on. In 2.0, Eclipse can be running on your  
workstation, but you can still monitor, launch and debug applications  
on remote machines.
</p></li>
<li>Port forwarding for remote connections
<p>
For sites that only allow a single ssh connection, 2.0 now adds  
support for tunneling all proxy and debug traffic across a single  
connection.

<li>Combined console
<p>
In addition to the per-process windows that display standard out, 2.0  
provides a single console window that combines output from all  
processes into a single view.

<li>Debugger improvements
<p>
Includes a completely re-designed debugger framework, improvements to  
line markers and marker colors, and tooltip popup display of variables.

<li>Parallel Language Development Tools
<p>
All the features of PLDT 2.0, including MPI Barrier analysis
and new wizards for conveniently creating MPI and OpenMP project.

<li>Update site support
<p>
PTP can now be completely downloaded and installed from an Eclipse  
update site.
