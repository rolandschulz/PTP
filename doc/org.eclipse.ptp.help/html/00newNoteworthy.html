<h1>Parallel Tools Platform (PTP) Release 2.1 - New and Noteworthy</h1>

<p>This version has had many enhancements and bug fixes since the 2.0  
release. Detailed PTP 2.1 release notes, including installation instructions, are available
    	at <a href="http://wiki.eclipse.org/PTP/release_notes/2.1">

<dt>Resource Managers</dt>
<dd>
New more flexible resource manager for Open MPI. This resource manager does not require a proxy agent to be running on the target system, and can be use as a 
template to target other MPI implementations. It also works with Open MPI 1.2 and 1.3.
Improvements have also been made to the Parallel Environment resource manager, as well as adding
support for the new debugger.
</dd>

<dl>
<dt>Parallel Debugger</dt>
<dd>
The debugger dependency on MPI has now been removed. This allows the debugger to work with virtually any MPI implementation. 
The debugger also provides a flexible architecture allows different routing and communication layers as well as 
full asynchronous command support
</dd>
<br>
<dl>
<dt>Parallel Language Development Tools (PLDT)</dt>
<dd>
Support for Unified Parallel C (UPC) has been added, along with new MPI code templates.
</dd>
<br>
<dl>
<dt>External Tools Framework (formerly the Performance Tools Framework)</dt>
<dd>
Support for PAPI Component counter selection has been added, along with parametric analysis capabilities 
(supported primarily for TAU at this time). Significant modifications have been made to increase work-flow flexibility
</dd>
<br>
<dl>
<dt>Remote Development Tools (RDT)</dt>
<dd>
A new Remote Development Tools environment that enables C and C++ projects to be located on a remote machine. 
RDT provides remote indexing and parsing services, a new remote C/C++ project wizard, automatic source code 
delta handling (the index is automatically updated when files in your project are added/removed/changed), 
remote "scanner info" support to allow the user to define include paths and defined preprocessor macros as a 
context for the parser to operate, and remote Search, Call Hierarchy, Navigation (e.g. Go To Declaration), 
Content Assist, and Type Hierarchy support. RDT also provides remote Standard Make functionality 
for building remote makefile-based projects.
</dd>
<br>
<dl>
<dt>Services Model</dt>
<dd>
The PTP service model allows the user to configure how services on their system are mapped to service providers
and locations (e.g. to a remote machine). This allows ISVs and tool implementers to define new services, and 
contribute providers to any defined services.
</dd>
<br>
<dl>
<dt>Cell/B.E. IDE</dt>
<dd>
The Cell/B.E. IDE provides a fully-featured IDE for developing applications for the Cell Broadband Engine. It includes
features such as custom source code templates for Cell development, full configurable build properties for PPU and 
SPU using GNU and XL compilers, managed build for PPU and SPU using GNU and XL compilers, remote launch and debug of 
Cell applications, and support for PPU & SPU combined remote debugger. The Cell/B.E. IDE also provides support for
Cell performance tools, the ALF programming model, IBM PDT (Performance Debug Tools) instrumentation plugins, and
Mambo Simulator plugins.
