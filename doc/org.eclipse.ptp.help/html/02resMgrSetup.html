<h2 id="defn">Resource Managers</h2>
<p>[needs updating] A Resource Manager controls resources for launching a parallel job.
It could be a real job scheduling program, or the simplest is ORTE for a local? job.
<p>In this example we will create a local resource manager for ORTE, in which the parallel
program will be launched and run on the local machine.
<h2 id="creat">Creating and Configuring Resource Managers</h2>
<p>First we will demonstrate <a href="#createRML">creating a local resource manager</a>, where PTP 
will control a cluster whose head node is on the local machine.  This was the
scenario that PTP 1.x handled.  Eclipse and PTP are installed on the cluster head node.
<p>Then we will demonstrate <a href="#configRMR">creating a remote resource manager</a>, where
Eclipse and PTP are on your local laptop or workstation, for example, and PTP
controls a remote cluster.  This is one of the most significant improvements in PTP 2.0.
A small set of PTP components need to be installed
on the remote node (need to list these, but basically the proxy and sdm -- the 
parts built by the "sh BUILD" step of ptp installation, need to be on the remote node.)

<h3 id="configRML">Creating and Configuring a Local Resource Manager</h3>

<p>To create a resource manager, first open the PTP Runtime Perspective.
(Window -> Open Perspective -> Other... and then choose "C/C++" from the list of perspectives.)

<p>To configure the simple case of a local ORTE Resource Manager,
Select <b>Local</b> as the Remote service provider.

<p>The proxy server location should be set to Local as well,
and  the Path to proxy server executable 
should point to your <code>ptp_orte_proxy</code> executable file.
It should probably be pointing to your plugins directory under your eclipse installation.
<br>Under Multiplexing options, <b>None</b> should be selected
and the local address for proxy connection should be set to your local address
(either IP address x.x.x.x or localhost).

<h3 id="configRMR">Creating and configuring a Remote Resource Manager</h3>
<p>
Remote Resource Managers allow control via PTP of a remote target machine.
This control can be accomplished via a variety of "remote service providers,"
which currently includes Eclipse RSE (Remote Systems Explorer) or the more
lightweight PTP Remote Tools, which you probably installed with PTP.

<p>The following instructions show how to configure a remote ORTE Resource Manager using the PTP Remote Tools.
<p>The example is a local machine running Windows XP, and the remote target machine running Linux (Fedora 7).
<p>Note: Caveat here about having source on local machine, to match executable located on remote machine.
<p>&nbsp;
<p>Add a new resource manager, of type ORTE.
<p>In the  PTP Runtime Perspective,
Right-click in Resource Managers view and select 
<b>Add Resource Manager...</b>
<br>
<img src="images/0104newRemoteResMgr.png">
<p>In the ORTE Proxy Configuration dialog, 
Select <b>Remote Tools </b> as the Remote service provider.
<br>
<img src="images/0104newORTEproxyRemote.png">
<p>Click New ... 
<br>
<img src="images/0104newRemoteHost.png">
<p>The proxy server location should be set to the hostname, or IP address, of the remote target machine.
<p>Note: assure that <code>sftp</code> works on the remote machine, with a known userid and password.
<p>Click Finish.

<p>
The Path to proxy server executable 
should point to your <code>ptp_orte_proxy</code> executable file on the target machine.
Navigate to, and select, the <code>ptp_orte_proxy</code> executable,
which is probably located in the eclipse/plugins/org.eclipse.ptp.<i>os.arch</i>.xxxx directory, where <i>os.arch</i> is the 
operating system and architecture of the remote target machine, and <code>xxxx</code> is the suffix on the plugins directory, probably
a release name and date suffix.
<br>
<img src="images/0104remoteBrowseProxy.png">
<br>
Click OK to close the browse dialog.

<br>Under Multiplexing options, select <b>None</b>.
The local address for proxy connection should be set to your local address
(either IP address x.x.x.x or hostname of your local machine: the pulldown menu should provide some alternatives or you can enter the hostname/IP Address manually).
This is the address with which the remote target machine will attempt to connect back with the local machine.
<br>

<p>Select Next.
<p>If ORTED configuration info is required enter it here.

<br>

<p>Select Next or Finish.

<p>Select Finish.
<p>The new Resource Manager should appear in the list of Resource
Managers.

<h2 id="startRMR">Starting the Remote Resource Manager</h2>

<p>&nbsp;
<h2 id="editRM">Editing the Resource Manager</h2>
<p>Note that the resource manager cannot be edited when it is running.  
Stop it first and then
it can be edited.
