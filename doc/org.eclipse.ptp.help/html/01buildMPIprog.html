<h2 id="create">Create an MPI Project</h2>
<p>To create a new MPI project in C using the managed build facility,
Select File -> New -> Project ...  The New Project dialog opens.
<br>Select C -> Managed Make C Project.
<p><b>Note: </b> for automatic setup of MPI project information,
see the PTP PLDT (Parallel Language Development Tools) help.

<br><img src="images/newProject.gif">
<br>Click Next.
<br>Type the name of your project, e.g. MyCProject
<br><img src="images/newProject2.gif">
<br>Click Finish.
<p>A dialog prompts you to switch to the C/C++ Perspective. Hit OK.
The C/C++ Perspective appears.
<p>Your new project is shown in the C/C++ Projects view.
<br><img src="images/cPersp.gif">
<p>Now create a source file.
Click File -> New -> Source File.  
<br>Type a name for the source file, e.g. "test.c"
<br><img src="images/newSourceFile.gif">
<br>Click Finish.
<p>A new editor appears, in which you can enter your program.
<br><img src="images/newEditor.gif">
<p>Since this is a managed build project, Eclipse creates a makefile
and tries to build with the new file.  Since the file is empty,
you will see errors in the Problems view, and in the Console view.
<br><img src="images/newFileErrors.gif">
<p>Enter a program in the editor.
(If you have the PTP PLDT installed, a sample program is available 
in the PTP MPI tools help, available as: 
<a href="../../org.eclipse.ptp.pldt.help/html/testMPI.c">testMPI.c</a>)
<!--  TODO I don't think that relative URL will work in installed plug-in --> 
<p>A sample "hello world" type MPI program is also a good
first test program:
<pre>
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;mpi.h&gt;
int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
    int rank;
    MPI_Init(&argc, &argv);
    MPI_Comm_rank(MPI_COMM_WORLD, &rank);
    printf(“my rank=%d\n”, rank);
    MPI_Finalize();
    return 0;
}

</pre>
<p>Save your program.  The program will be compiled automatically by
the managed build system.
<p>You may see several errors, if you haven't set up the
MPI information for your project.
The first error may be that an include file isn't found.
<br><img src="images/errorInclude.gif">
<br>(If you hover the mouse cursor over the red "X"
you will see the reason for the error)
<h2 id="include">Include Paths</h2>
<p>In order to locate needed include files, bring up the Project Properties on this C/C++ project.

<br>To bring up the Project Properties dialog,
activate the context menu  on the Project, and select "Properties."
<br><img src="images/projProps.gif">
<p>
The project properties window is displayed for this C project.
Select "C/C++ Build" on the left, and under "Configuration settings" 
on the "Tool Settings" tab, select "Directories" under "GCC Compiler."
This lists the Include paths used to build the project, which are now
empty.
 
<br><img src="images/propsBuild.gif">
<p>To add an include path, click the add button for Include Paths.
<br><img src="images/includePathsAdd.gif">
<p>Then enter or browse to find the location of the MPI includes, and
select "OK."
<br><img src="images/includePathsAddDlg.gif">
<p>Now you also need to add the path to the library: Under GCC Linker,
Libraries, select the add button for "Libraries (-l)" 

<br><img src="images/projPropsLnkLib.gif">
<p>For the library value, enter 'mpi' and select 'OK'
<br><img src="images/linkerDlg.gif">
<p>Then select the add button for  "Library Search Path (-L)" 
and enter the path to the lib directory.  Select 'OK'
<br><img src="images/libDlg.gif">
<p>Now select "OK" in the project properties dialog to close this dialog.
Now your project should rebuild without errors relating to finding
the include files.
<p>
<h2 id="mpicc">Specifying the mpicc toolchain</h2>

<p>Now specify the build/link command.
Again in Project properties, C/C++ build page, Tool Settings tab,
click on "GCC C compiler"
and change the default "gcc" value to "mpicc"
(or whatever the build command is for your MPI environment).
<br><img src="images/projPropsMpicc.gif">
<p>Then do the same for the "GCC C Linker."
<br><img src="images/projPropsMpicc2.gif">
<p>Now proceed to <a href="02pLaunchConfig.html">launch the parallel program.</a>
