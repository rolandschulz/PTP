<h2 id="persp">PTP Runtime Perspective</h2>
<p>To populate the PTP Runtime perspective, you should have
a program running.  See <a href="02pLaunchConfig.html">launching parallel programs </a> for how to launch a parallel program.
<p>To open the PTP Runtime perspective,
Select Window > Open Perspective > Other ... and Select PTP Runtime.
<p>The PTP Runtime Perspective includes several views including those of Resource Manager,
Machines, Jobs, and Process Ouput.
<p><img src="images/0104runtimePerspAnn.gif">
<p>Each of these views will be discussed below.
<p>
<h2 id="resMgr">Resource Managers View</h2>
<p>The available <a href="02resMgrSetup.html">resource managers</a> are shown.  The icon color indicates the current state.
Right mouse actions on the resource manager allow it to be started, stopped, edited, and removed.
Note that if a resource manager is removed and re-added, the launch configurations using the original resource
manager must be changed to use the new one.

<h2 id="machines"><img src="images/fromPTP/parallel_perspective.gif">Machines View</h2>
<p>
<p>

<td>In the Machines view, an icon represents each machine and node.
<br><img src="images/0104runtimeMachinesView.png"></td>
<p>Machine and Node icons indicate the status of each machine and node:
<br><img src="images/0104ptpLegendMachines.png">

<p> <b>Selecting a node:</b>
Double-click on a node icon to display the node information.
For each node, the jobs that 
have run on the node are displayed, and for each job selected, the processes than ran in the job.
(See the full picture of the runtime perspective at the top of this page.)

<p> <b>Node state icons:</b>
Each node in the machines view is indicated by an icon.
The icons and their meanings are shown in the <a href="#legend">Legend dialog</a>,
available from the
<img src="images/legendIcon.gif"> legend icon in the toolbar.  


<p><b>'Hover' information:</b>
You can see information about a particular node by hovering the
mouse pointer over a node.
<p><b>Node information:</b>
To display information on a particular node, double-click
on the node icon and the Node info box
will be populated with information about that node.

<h2 id="jobs"><img src="images/fromPTP/parallel_perspective.gif">Jobs View</h2>
<p>In the Jobs view, the current status of jobs is shown.
Running and completed jobs are listed.
The jobs are shown in the left pane, and the processes running
in the selected job are shown in the right pane.
<p>Hovering over a process shows the MPI task ID and process ID.
The zoom icons affect the sizes of the process icons. 
The terminate button can be used to kill a job.
The {} icons allow creation of 
<a href="04ptpDebugPersp.html#pSets">process sets</a>,
for controlling groups of processes at once.
<br><img src="images/0104ptpRuntimeJobsViewHover.png">
<p>The Job and Process icons are show here:
<br><img src="images/0104ptpLegendJobProcess.png">
<h2 id="pdetails">Process Details View</h2>
<p><b>Selecting a process: </b>
Double-clicking on a process in the right pane of the Jobs view
brings up a details view for that process.
<br><img src="images/0104ptpRuntimeProcessDetails.png"> 


<p>The process details page includes the following information:
<ul>
<li>Index: MPI task identifier
<li>Node: node number this process is running on
<li>Total: total number of processes in this job
<li>PID: UNIX process identifier
<li>Job: Job number of the job containing this process
<li>Status: current status of process (starting, running, suspended, exited)
</ul>
<p>
The Program output window shows the standard output generated by this  
process.

<h2 id="legend">PTP Icon Legend</h2>

<p>Again, the icons and their meanings are shown in the Legend dialog,
available from the
<img src="images/legendIcon.gif"> legend icon in the toolbar.  The entire legend dialog is shown below.
It shows icons for Resource Managers, Machines, Nodes, Jobs, and Processes.
