<h1 id="top">Launching Parallel Programs</h1>
<p>This section describes how to launch a parallel program. Launching requires the services of a resource manager, which should have been set up as described in <a href="02resMgrSetup.html">Resource Managers</a>. PTP is able to launch applications that have been compiled to use an MPI runtime system, those compiled to use the OpenMP system, and a combination of MPI and OpenMP. It is also possible to launch multiple copies of a sequential program so that they execute simultaneously.

<h2 id="create">Step 1: Create a parallel launch configuration</h2>
<p>Note: At least one resource manager must have been configured and started before it is possible to create
a parallel launch configuration.
<ol>
<li><p>Open the run configuration dialog using <b>Run &gt; Open Run Dialog...</b>
or click the run icon menu on the tool bar and select <b>Open Run Dialog...</b></p></li>
<li><p>Create a new parallel launch configuration by clicking <b>Parallel Application</b> and
then clicking on the <b>New</b> button icon.</p>
<p><script> thumb("images/03launch1.png") </script></p>
</li>
<li><p>Enter a name for the configuration in the <b>Name:</b> field. Here we use the same name as the project.</p></li>
</ol>

<h2 id="main">Step 2: Complete the <b>Main</b> tab</h2>
<ol>
<li><p>Select a resource manager from the drop-down (Note: a resource manager
must be running for it to appear in the list.)</p></li>
<li><p>Ensure that the correct the <b>Parallel Project</b> is selected</p></li>
<li><p>Select the <b>Application Program</b> (executable) that you wish to launch by clicking on the <b>Browse</b> button. If you are running the application on the local machine, you will need to navigate to the workspace and project directory. In this case, and if you are using a debug configuration, the executable will be located in the Debug folder of your project.</p>
<p>If you are running the application on a remote machine you will need to navigate to the location of the executable on that machine. If the project was <i>built</i> locally, then you will have to manually copy the executable to the remote machine first.</p>
<p><script> thumb("images/03launch2.png") </script></p>
</li>
<li><p>If you wish to have the output from all processes in a single output console,
check the <b>Display combined output in a console view</b> option.
<p><script> thumb("images/03combinedConsole1.png") </script></p>
</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="resources">Step 3: Complete the Resources tab</h2>
<p>The <b>Resources tab</b> is used to specify the resources required for the job execution. The contents of this tab will vary for different resource managers. This description only applys to the Open MPI and MPICH2 resource managers.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>The <b>Queue:</b> drop-down should be showing <b>default</b> and be disabled. This indicates that this resource manager does not support multiple queues.</p></li>
<li><p>Enter a value in the <b>Number of Processes</b> field. This field must be greater than 0 in order to launch a job, and specifies the number of processes to use for the application launch.</p>
<p><script> thumb("images/03launchResTab.png") </script></p>
</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="debugger">Step 4: Complete the Debugger tab</h2>
The <b>Debugger tab</b> is only required if you are planning to debug the application. However it is a good idea to complete it now, even if you are only planning to launch a non-debug job.
<ol>
<li><p>Select a debugger from the <b>Debugger</b> drop-down. This is the debugger that will control the parallel debug session. Currently only <b>SDM</b> is supported (SDM stands for Scalable Debug Manager), so select this.</p></li>
<li><p>If you wish the debugger to automatically suspend the application on launch, make sure <b>Stop in main() on startup</b> is checked</p></li>
<li><p>Under Debugger options, make sure that the path to debugger executable is correct.</p>
<p>If you are debugging on the local machine, this path should point to the <code>sdm</code> executable in your Ecilpse installation's <code>plugins/org.eclipse.ptp.<i>os.arch_version</i>/bin</code> directory,
where <code><i>os.arch_version</i></code> is your operating system (<code>linux</code>, <code>macosx</code>, or <code>aix</code>), 
architecture (<code>x86</code>, <code>x86_64</code>, or <code>ppc</code>), and version number of the plugin (e.g. <code>2.0.0.200803261107</code>).</p>
<p>If you are debugging remotely, then this path will be the path to where the <code>sdm</code> executable was installed on the remote machine.</p></li>
<li><p>Set the <b>Debugger session address</b>. This is the address that the debugger will connect to when it starts, and will depend on where you are launching the application:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>If you are launching onto the local machine, use <code>localhost</code> (some systems will accept <code>localhost.localdomain</code>).</p></li>
<li><p>If you are launching onto a remote machine without using port forwarding (as specified in the resource manager configuration), then this should be the address of the local machine (the one running Eclipse) <i>as viewed from one of the nodes of the parallel machine</i>. Note that if the parallel machine configuration precludes nodes accessing your local machine, you will need to reconfigure the resource manager to use port forwarding.</p></li>
<li><p>If you are launching onto a remote machine using port forwarding, this is the address of the remote machine 
<i>as viewed from one of its nodes</i>
<p><script> thumb("images/03launch5.png") </script></p>
</p></li>
</ul>

</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="arguments">Step 5: Complete the Arguments tab</h2>
<ol>
<li><p>Enter any <i>program</i> arguments.</p></li>
<li><p>Select a different working directory if desired. Note that for a remote launch, this will be the location of the exeuction on the remote machine.</p></li>
</ol>

<h2 id="launch">Step 6: Launching the application</h2>
<p>The launch configuration is now complete. Click on the <b>Run</b> button to launch the program.
At this point the application should begin execution. 
The <a href="05monitoring.html">Monitoring Parallel Machines and Jobs</a> section will show you how to
monitor the program's execution.</p>
