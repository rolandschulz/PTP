<h2 id="feat">Main features of the PTP Debug perspective</h2>
<p>Note: the Process View in the following screen shot
is also known as the Debug View.

<h2>Launching a parallel debug session</h2>
<ul>
<li>Create a Parallel Application for Debug launch
similar to creating it for Run... 
(See <a href="02pLaunchConfig.html">Launching parallel programs</a>,
but the necessary information is given below.)
</li>
<p>In the Debug launch dialog (Run -> Debug ... or use the Debug
icon on the eclipse toolbar)
<li>Select 'Debugger' tab..
<li>Select 'Stop in main' to automatically stop the job</li>
<li>Make sure the Debugger is set to "SDM" - use the pulldown menu.
<li>Change any other default settings (not normally required)</li>
<li>Select the Debug button (or hit "Apply" to save these settings
if you do not intend to launch immediately.)
<br><img src="images/parDebugConfig.gif">
<p>For existing Parallel Application launch configurations,
you can simply
launch using the debug button rather than the Run button
<p>
<img src="images/parDebugIcon.gif">
</li>

<li>Eclipse will switch to the PTP Debug perspective.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="pSets">Process Sets</h2>
<p>Traditional debuggers apply operations to a single
process.  Parallel debugging operations apply to a single process
<i>or to arbitrary collections of processes.</i> 
<p>A <i>process set </i> is a means of simultaneously referring
to one or more processes.

<p>When a parallel debug session is first started, all processes are placed
in a set, called the 'Root' set.  Sets are always associated with a single Job.
A job can have any number of process sets.  A set can contain from 1 to the
number of processes in a job.
<p><img src="images/pSets.gif">
<h2 id="pSetsOper">Operations on Process sets</h2>
<p>
<br><img src="images/pSetOper.gif">
<p>
<ul>
<li>Create/add to set</li>
<li>Delete set</li>
<li>Remove from set</li>
<li>Change current set</li>
</ul>
<p>Debug operations always apply to the current set.
<br><img src="images/pSetDebug.gif">

<h2 id="pSetsCreate">Creating Process Sets</h2>
<p><!-- TODO : need screenshots here--> 
<p>Select the processes to be placed in the set
by selecting a rectangular region with the mouse,
or click the mouse and shift-click or ctrl-click to 
select a contiguous region, or separate processes, respectively.
<br><img src="images/pSetSelect.gif">
<p>
<p>Choose the set to add processes to
<br><img src="images/pSetChoose.gif">
<p>To remove processes from a set, select the processes
as described above, and remove them.
<br><img src="images/pSetSelect.gif">
<p>To change the current process set, select the icon
<img src="images/pSetChooseIcon.gif">
and choose from the list.  Clicking on the icon will cycle through
the sets.)
<br><img src="images/pSetChange.gif">
<p>Select the "Delete Set" icon to delete the current process set.
<br><img src="images/pSetDelete.gif">

<h2 id="bkpt">Breakpoints</h2>
<p>There are two main types of breakpoints.
<ul>
<li><i>Global Breakpoints</i> apply to <i>all</i> processes in <i>any</i> job. 

<br><img src="images/bkptGlobal.gif">

</li>
<li><i>Set Breakpoints</i> apply only to a process in a particular set
for a single job. 
<p>Green indicates the breakpoint is applied to the current set. 
<br>Blue indicates the breakpoint is applied to some other set.
<br><img src="images/bkptSet.gif">

 </li>

</ul>

<h3>Setting Breakpoints</h3><p>
To create a breakpoint, double-click on the left edge of 
an editor window, at the line on which you want to set the breakpoint.
Or, right click and use the context menu.
<br><img src="images/bkptSetContext.gif">
<p>A global breakpoint is created if no jobs are selected.
If a job is selected, the breakpoint will apply to the current set.
<h3>Breakpoint information</h3>
<p>Hover over a breakpoint to see more information.
<br><img src="images/bkptHover.gif">
<p>Use the Breakpoints view to see all breakpoints.
<br><img src="images/bkptsView.gif">
<p>Use the menu in the Breakpoints view to group breakpoints
by type.
<br><img src="images/bkptsViewMenu.gif">

<h2 id="cip">Current Instruction Pointer</h2>
<p>The current instruction pointer is used to show the current
location of <i>suspended</i> processes.
In traditional programs, there is a single instruction pointer.
(The exception to this is multi-threaded programs.)
In parallel programs, there is an instruction pointer for every process.
<p>The PTP debugger shows one instruction pointer for
<i>every group of processes at the same location</i>.
<blockquote><b>Note:</b> The group of processes represented by an instruction pointer
is not necessarily the same as a process set.</blockquote>
<p>In the normal debugger, the single instruction pointer
is indicated with the blue arrow icon.  The current source line is also highlighted.
<br><img src="images/sip.gif">
<p>In the PTP (parallel) debugger, there are multiple instruction pointers.
<br><img src="images/mip.gif">
<p>Hovering over the instruction pointer provides additional information.
<br><img src="images/cipHover.gif">
<h2 id="reg">Process Registration and the Debug View</h2> 

<p>Process set commands apply to groups of processes.
For finer control and more detailed information, a process can be
<i>registered</i> and isolated in the Debug View.
<p>
Registered processes, including their stack traces, appear in the 'Debug' view.
Any number of processes can be registered,
and processes can be registered or un-registered at any time.
<p>To register a process, double-click its process icon in the Jobs view.
Note that the process "diamond" then is surrounded by a box.
The process appears in the debug view.
<br><img src="images/reg1.gif">
<p>To un-register a process, double-click on the same icon.
The box disappears, and the process is removed from the debug view.
<p>Note that the debug commands (icons including run, step, etc.)
in the toolbar of the Jobs view (tab title: Parallel Debug)
control the currently selected process set.
The debug commands in the toolbar of the Debug view 
control the single process that is currently selected  in that view.

<h2>Putting it all together</h2>
<p>Note that with the above instructions, you should now be able to do the following:
<ul>
<li>Set a global breakpont
<br><i>Double-click in the area to the left of the source line. You should see
the global breakpoint icon <img src="images/globalBkpt.gif"> appear. </i>
</li>
<li>Start a 100 process job
<br><i>Use the menu: Debug->Debug... Make a launch configuration (or reuse one).
On the Parallel tab, specify 100 processes.</i>
</li>
<li>When the breakpoint is reached,</li>
  <ul>
  <li>Create a process set containing processes 0-10 (set_1)
  <br><i>In the Parallel Debug view, select a group of the process diamonds,
  which should be yellow=stopped processes. 
  Select a rectangular region with the mouse, or click the mouse and shift-click 
  or ctrl-click to select a contiguous region, or separate processes, respectively. 
  Then click the <img src="images/createProcessSet.gif"> button and give
  the process the name "set_1"
  </i>
  <li>Create a process set containing processes 20-30 (set_2)
  <br><i>Same as above.</i>
  <li>Single step all processes
  <br><i>Use the step-over icon <img src="images/fromPTP/stepover_normal.gif"> in the toolbar of the 
  Parallel Debug View (near the top).</i>
  <li>Single step processes in set_1
  <br><i>Make sure the process set is selected via
  <img src="images/selectProcessSet.gif">, then use the step-over icon <img src="images/fromPTP/stepover_normal.gif"> in the toolbar of the 
  Parallel Debug View (near the top).</i>
  <li>Register a process
  <br><i>Double-click on the process icon diamond.  It should then have a rectangle around it. </i>
  <li>Single step the registered process
  <br><i>Select the process in the debug view (near the center of the screen), and Use the step-over icon <img src="images/fromPTP/stepover_normal.gif"> in the toolbar of the 
  Debug View (near the top).</i>
  <li>Select a stack frame and view the variables
  <br><i></i>
  </ul>
<li>Terminate execution</li>

</ul>
