</title>

<body>
<h1> <img src="images/fromPTP/parallel_perspective_lg.gif"> Parallel Tools Platform</h1>
<p>Release 2.0
<p>
The Parallel Tools Platform is designed to allow the Eclipse  
framework to be used for developing applications for parallel  
computer systems. PTP provides the following functionality:
<ul><li>
tools for developing applications based on the Message Passing  
Interface (MPI) standard (other environments and APIs will follow.)
<li> the ability to launch,  control and monitor the execution of  
parallel programs
<li> the ability to monitor parallel system status information
<li> an integrated parallel debugger
</ul>
In addition, PTP provides a platform for parallel tool developers to  
integrate their tools within the Eclipse framework. New tools can  
take advantage of the user interface components and parallel  
services  that are provided by PTP, without the need to develop and  
support this infrastructure across multiple platforms.
