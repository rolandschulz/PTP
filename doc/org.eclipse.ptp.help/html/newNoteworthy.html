<h1>Parallel Tools Platform (PTP) Release 1.1 - New and Noteworthy</h1>
<p>The 1.1 release of PTP gives some new functionality, some bug fixes, and some
increased scalability to continue to enhance development and debug capabilities
for parallel projects.

    <td width="70%" valign="top">
    The  Parallel Language Development Tools (PLDT) now replaces and generalizes the
    MPI Language Tools framework.
	This will allow other programming models and parallel languages to use the static analysis
	features.

    <td width="70%" valign="top">Static analysis of OpenMP codes has been added to PLDT. This
provides similar functionality to the MPI support, but includes additional
support for detecting certain OpenMP common problems, #pragma regions, and
some simple conconcurrency analysis.

    <td width="70%" valign="top">The debugger has been enhanced to improve
scalability on very large parallel machines. It is has been tested on a 1000
process job.
<p>Zoom in / Zoom out on process icons allows more processes to be 
displayed in the Machines view of the Parallel Debug Perspective;
a similar zoom in/out is available in the Parallel Runtime Perspective's views.

variables are fetched and displayed in the UI in order to improve
performance. 
<p>If you open the PTP Variable View (Window -> Show View -> Other)
you can add a variable.

<p>The following PTP Variable Dialog allows you to select a variable or expression,
and a process set (use Root for all processes) for which to create the variable to watch for each process.

Then when you mouse over a process icon in the
Parallel Debug view, it will show the value of the variable in the tooltip.

    <td width="70%" valign="top">PTP supports a large range of
machine architectures, operating systems and parallel runtime
systems.
In 1.1, dynamically linked executables have  been deprecated, and
build scripts have been improved so this only requires one command
for PTP installation.
